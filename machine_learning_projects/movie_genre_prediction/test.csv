8,My God. <BR> But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses... <BR> It's fantastic.  I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand this but anytime Dickie does something I feel guilty.
9,We combine everything. You are my second in command. <BR> What about the share. <BR> You get fifteen percent. <BR> I got partners. <BR> Your Calabrian friend I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us. <BR> And the Jews? <BR> Share with them as you wish. Do business with them on your own. But no filthy Jew will ever be a brother to me.

22,"Sherman set the Wayback Machine for...oh 1973. Kevin Flynn  is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night and sets up a private memory file and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing called...  ...Space Paranoids. <BR> You invented Space Paranoids? <BR> Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has invented"""" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now Executive V.P.?"" <BR> Senior exec. <BR> Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime. <BR> I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system. <BR> Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it."
23,Who have we got? <BR> We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point. <BR> You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance. <BR> Admittance form is wrong. <BR> Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash. <BR> I've got my Dr. Gruber says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway plus she came in complaining of stomach pains... <BR> ...Gruber's not bad. <BR> Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare the jury's going to love him Mick... And you calm down all right? Their guy Towler's the author of the book  'Methodology and Practice Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses everybody in the operating room the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse? <BR> No. <BR> 'Mary Rooney forty-nine. Lives in Arlington still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up. <BR> Right. <BR> Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan. <BR> Right. <BR> Brindisi versus Electric Boat. <BR> You got a good memory Franky. <BR> I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
24,Huh? <BR> Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much you're takin' all my pills too? <BR> I didn't take your pills. <BR> Look - for my ulcer I take a half a one of these a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em? <BR> You didn't have to beat him up! <BR> What?
25,Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend. <BR> We've all seemed a little tense lately... <BR> Come to think of it I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me... <BR> We're never deeply angry we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well... <BR> So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me... <BR> You're Margo. Just - Margo. <BR> And what is that? Besides something spelled out in light bulbs I mean. Besides something called temperament which consists mostly of swooping about on a broomstick creaming at the top of my voice... infants behave the way I do you know. They carry on and misbehave - they'd get drunk if they knew how - when they can't have what they want. When they feel unwanted and insecure - or unloved.
26,Cut it out girls.  Stop it. Joe - Josephine - help! <BR> Hey she's ticklish!
27,What else John.  It must be different huh?  Are people living on the moon? <BR> Didn't happen we got enough problems down here. <BR> What are we like in...1998? <BR> We're okay...we're good Dad. <BR> Hey what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off? <BR> You really wanna know? <BR> Yeah you betcha. <BR> Well game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won Pop. <BR> Wow.
28,Jeez she used to say I was the lucky one. <BR> Let's hope so Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
29,This is nuts. <BR> What <u>is</u> your problem? <BR> Ten minutes ago I'm looking forward to a quiet dinner.  I get a note...
30,Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets.  Besides I'm not IRA no more. <BR> So where do you go from here? <BR> I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire that sort of thing. <BR> I'm up for that...
31,Jesus Pop how can you stand the cold dressed like that? Where's Ma? <BR> Sleeping. <BR> You remember Margie Fogg? <BR> From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee? <BR> How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while. <BR> We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her? <BR> Yeah.
32,Its give and take time Mr Lombard. You need help we need information. You didnt really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it did you? <BR> A criminal? <BR> Did you not enter this country illegally?
33,I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on. <BR> You can't just stroll down the road you know.
34,What happens now? <BR> The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. -- The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...
35,It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough but you wouldn't listen. <BR> It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are and even if they did they have nothing to connect them with us nothing at all. <BR> I'm glad you're so certain Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better. <BR> I beg your pardon?
36,I can't help you anymore Jimmy. I'm sorry. <BR> I'm going to need a way to get there.
37,...where is my pill? <BR> ON THE MEN IN THE ROOM ARGUING ABOUT THE ILLEGAL ALIEN SCHUMANN IN THE B.G. <BR> WHERE'S MY FUCKING <u>PIIIILLLLLLL</u>...?
38,Nah. <BR> Why not? You stink. <BR> That shit gives me a rash all under my arms and around my stomach. I like my odor. It's fuckin' natural.
39,Where do you think you're going? <BR> You gotta let me go Daddy. Please...
40,Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble. <BR> I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up. <BR> Don't seem so bad to me. <BR> Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look since you're here maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick. <BR> Okay.
41,Do you remember who gave us this? <BR> No. <BR> There's no card or anything.
42,What's the idea Anne? <BR> The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately. <BR> Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable? <BR> Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom? <BR> Now wait don't get excited Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house haven't I? <BR> Your house? <BR> O-o-oh I get you  All right. All right. I don't blame you. I kinda forgot myself for a moment there. That's what I call getting me told isn't it Anne?
43,This isn't working out for me anymore. <BR> Yeah me neither.
44,Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried. <BR> Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews tell him what's going on.
45,You see like you and I... <BR> You are extremely sexy. <BR> No I'm not. <BR> Unbelievably sexy. Yes you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse. <BR> Well what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is. <BR> Uh... uh you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you. <BR> Ooooh!
46,Ma. Pa.  Grampa his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and bewildered scratches in the dirt. <BR> And can't nobody *make* me go either! Ain't nobody here *man* enough to make me! I'm a-stayin'.
47,Tomorrow night. <BR> No.  Tonight.  It's important!
48,Damn they always stick me with the clunker. <BR> Take my van!
49,...he wants to testify...? <BR> It looks that way. <BR> You know what that would mean? <BR> To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify? <BR> ...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told you that.
50,So Krueger thinks Jason's dead... leaves him in the lake... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore... crawls off into the woods... where he lives the rest of his life alone. <BR> Alone... but with a murderous fury inside him... which led him to kill dozens of people.
51,Have you ever felt like this about anyone else? <BR>  <BR> No of course not silly -- I mean FELT like this about them? <BR> You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else? <BR> No I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams? <BR> HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else? <BR> What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before... <BR> It was different... <BR> What was she like? <BR> Oh... oh I didn't know her very well... <BR> But you LOVED her all the same... <BR> We never went to bed together. <BR> Why do you go on about that? What does it matter? <BR> You've been to bed with somebody else haven't you? <BR> I've never LOVED anybody! <BR> I've never been to bed with anybody!
52,Hang on! <BR> Dad!  Dad! <BR> I'm okay baby I'm here.  It's okay....
53,"I want to go back! <BR> Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go."
54,Can I come in? <BR> Oh please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here.
55,You can't know for certain that he won't see you. <BR> Trust me Violet.
56,We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here? <BR> No. No one has stopped here in weeks... <BR> Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself? <BR> Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman. <BR> Look at the picture. Please.
57,Is that a serious offer? <BR> I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back. <BR> Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official. <BR> Okay. <BR> Done. No matter how clever he is he still needs an exit visa or I should say two. <BR> Why two? <BR> He is traveling with a lady. <BR> He'll take one. <BR> I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles or in Oran he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca. <BR> Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are. <BR> It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him. <BR> Louis whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape? <BR> Because my dear Ricky I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.
58,Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing. <BR> ... I know it's you Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it... <BR> Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous? <BR> I'm serious Bruce. We have to -- !
59,Mom Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed. <BR> Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean for god's sake we own a grocery store!
60,No. At least I don't recall. <BR> She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name but she might've registered... <BR> I don't even bother with guests registering any more... I mean little by little you drop the formalities.  I shouldn't even bother to change the linen. I guess habits die hard. Which reminds me...
61,Gino Marzzone. <BR> Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone head of the Marzzone family? <BR> That's his brother. <BR> ...  shit.
62,Can we go up? Do you mind? <BR> Of course. What happened to your face? <BR> My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.
63,You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well it's been six months and I was looking forward to seeing my son. <BR> I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
64,That's how it is chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good. <BR> What is it you want? <BR> I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki. <BR> I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large. <BR> Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want man. I just want your word.
65,"You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you. <BR> Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you. <BR> We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you. <BR> You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you. <BR> I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you. <BR> The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you."
66,Fuck that!  AGAGH!! <BR> We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
67,It's OK. There's no problem. <BR> You mean I can have the room? <BR> Well that's what I said isn't it?
68,Peekaboo you fucks you. <BR> I see you you motherfuckers. <BR> The problem was Nicky was not only bringin' heat on himself but on me too. The FBI watched every move he made. But he didn't care. He just didn't care.
69,Just in case someone gets a shot off. <BR> I worked ten years without one I don't need one now. <BR> Suit yourself. <BR> Okay.

71,The Fifth Element... <BR> Take them and put them in a safe place.
72,So Frank am I going to live? <BR> You're going to live. <BR> I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place. <BR> I was tired. I needed a coffee. <BR> What about Kanita? <BR> Dead. <BR> That's too bad. Get some money a nice looking girl on your arm and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house shooting at me. Damn I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat that's why falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight and look what happens. Am I shot Frank? <BR> No. <BR> Boy can't shoot for shit either. Goddamn that's hot.
73,You're here... I'm a bit surprised. <BR> Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep. <BR> I'm going to try hard not to understand the implications of that simile.
74,From his landlord -- once a month. <BR> It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative. <BR> You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations. <BR> I do? <BR> Staying the night here uninvited.

Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy. <BR> What ever happened to just bowling? <BR> There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive. <BR> I like the sport the way it is. <BR> A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch.

Except for you you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around... <BR> Well teacher's away and actors will be actors... <BR> During your second act scene with your father Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night... <BR> When he gets too close I'll spit in his eye.
97,He didn't come back here? <BR> Sam. <BR> No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling. <BR> Where could he have gone? <BR> Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on... <BR> Without calling me? <BR> In a hurry. <BR> Sam he called me when he had nothing definite nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything... <BR> Yes. I think he would have.
98,What do we do now? <BR> I don't know about you but I plan to wait here.
99,Uh... you-you wanna lift? <BR> Oh why-uh... y-y-you gotta car? <BR> No um... I was gonna take a cab. <BR> Oh no I have a car. <BR>  <BR> I don't...  I don't... Geez I don't know I've...

100,I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry. <BR> No I'm the one who's sorry. I misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse me I have some oozing to do.
101,It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it too? <BR> What? What am I supposed to sense? <BR> The house - Tommi - something just doesn't jive here...
102,You could have stopped him. <BR> Ya never tell a guy about a broad. <BR> So you all make the same mistakes? <BR> Gives us something in common.

105,Don't pay attention to him Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about. <BR> Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia.

Don't you think I'm lucky Gallagher? <BR> Sure - I think so Stew. <BR> I knew you would pal.  A bird in a gilded cage eh? <BR> How is her family going to feel about it? <BR> Her family? Oh they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
106,John they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job and I can appreciate that but you're just dragging this thing out. None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA police and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works. <BR> Ellis what have you told them? <BR> I told them we're old friends and you were my guest at the party.
107,Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest... <BR> Vito Cornelius?

No no no 'cause I never shower in a public place. <BR> Why not? <BR> 'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man you know-it's uh... <BR> Oh I see I see. <BR> You know I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender- <BR> Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah I see. I guess- <BR> 'cause uh you never know what's gonna happen. <BR> Fifteen years huh? <BR> Fifteen years yeah. <BR> Yeah. Oh God bless!
109,You let him go --  An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less this one didn't even talk. <BR> He will.

111,He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll have to hurry. <BR> Bourne comes here? Why?
112,Problem where? Looked good to me. <BR>  <BR> So disengage his Flail Arm Mechanism and just make him a screamer.
113,Im calling about the puppies. <BR> Have we done business before? <BR> I saw the ad at Georges.  Im passing through town and Im in a hurry. <BR> May I have your phone number? <BR> Why? <BR> This is a bad line.
114,Not really.  Yes the Fisher wedding chairs... <BR> Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.
115,Other than that... You all right? <BR> ...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice I'll never forgive you!!
116,There's something wrong with this picture. <BR> What picture? <BR> I'm talking about you. <BR> Me? <BR> Yeah you.
117,Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you? <BR> You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not. <BR> Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in? <BR> I don't think I'll tell you. <BR> He's right-handed. <BR> Most people are. <BR> He's misunderstood. <BR> Cut the general crap.
118,Mick I know it's late but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet. <BR> What?  They ain't there? <BR> No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's but no answer. <BR> Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere okay? <BR> Okay sure Mick. <BR> Caesar you still got the money?
119,My Jewish friend's grandmother did. <BR> Well no one in my family did! Dad bought cemetery plots at Oak Ridge. One for him one for mom.
120,The soldiers were provoked.  The students started it for Christ's sake! <BR> Sir there's dead American kids here. Let's say we don't apologize for Kent State but maybe we could have a national prayer day ...
121,Ummm... <BR> If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote.
122,Oh okay. Like this. <BR> You've never been to a dance have you? <BR> Only squares and nerds go to dances. <BR> What are you? <BR> I don't know.
123,We're just not a very musical nation... <BR> No no... It was very... er nice. <BR> Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY totally genuinely honest with me. Did you really truly honestly like it?
124,So what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway? <BR> I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein. <BR> Well you might as well get somethin' out of it.
125,Wally thinks apples are boring. <BR> I never said they were boring. <BR>  <BR> Well they aren't.
126,"I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation. <BR> You can't quit, Scully. <BR> I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew -- <BR> We're close to something here -- we're on the verge -- <BR> You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me -- <BR> After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away -- <BR> I have. I did. It's done. <BR> Just like that -- <BR> I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers -- <BR> I need you on this, Scully -- <BR> You don't Mulder -- you've never needed me. I've only held you back.  I've got to go."
127,Hey Bleek. <BR> Hey cool tiger. Looks proud. <BR> Yeah I swiped it from Ms. Rancick. <BR> Cool. <BR> Your shorts are looking especially gold today. <BR> My mom uses color-safe bleach. <BR> Go Carole.  So guess what? <BR> I don't know... <BR> I'm pregnant.
128,I better go. <BR> I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
129,--That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control-- <BR> --Mitchell Stans Magruder Kalmbach-- <BR> --we're working on the last guy now and we're going all the way--that fifth man was Haldeman.
130,Shut up James. <BR> So what's the problem? <BR> There is no problem. Did I say there was a problem?
131,And why are you so glum? <BR> I expected action.  There was no killing no fighting I was useless.
132,You have to tell me what you thought of the play. <BR> First you tell me. <BR> Brilliantly moving.
133,Excuse me for having something important to do. <BR> This isn't important?  The earth is our home. <BR> Kimberly it's a dance.  It's a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that I see every stupid day.
134,Where have you been? <BR> Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you? <BR> You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers. <BR> Why are you so surly -- you've won brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet. <BR> What is that... wailing? <BR> The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
135,That's puttering sir. <BR> No! Well well well! That's all right if you like it. Can anybody do that? <BR> Oh no sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it. <BR> Oh my. You mean some people are born and never will become putterers? <BR> Yes sir. <BR> Oh my wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer. <BR> Yes sir. <BR> How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it that some day I might be a putterer? <BR> You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer sir. <BR> Well if I couldn't be a good putterer I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer? <BR> Well sir to be a putterer one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance sir a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage because he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir if you will pardon me with all due respect sir as a Smythe to a Smith you are an eagle in a cage. <BR> A bird in a gilded cage? <BR> Yes. <BR> That's all I wanted to know!
136,I think he's doing Dolly. <BR>  <BR> Definitely Whitney.
137,I'm... I'm uh I'm Robert Redford. <BR> Come on. <BR> Alvy Singer. It was nice nice... Thanks very much... for everything.
138,Who's first? <BR> Alphabetically on the CREEP phone list Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.
139,Are you tapping Kissinger? <BR> My job unpleasant sometimes is to know what others don't want me to know. <BR> Not if you have spies in the White House it isn't your job. <BR> It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own. <BR> Mr. Helms we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ... <BR> ... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy. <BR> CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago. <BR> Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
140,...mmm. <BR> ...'bout ready to Mix it Up...? <BR> Is today Laundry Day...?
141,We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean <BR> I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ... <BR> You hear me? <BR> I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
142,You going to wait here for me? <BR> I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in... <BR> We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place inside and... outside. <BR> You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers! <BR> I believe it.
143,"Get out of the way. <BR> Are you crazy? <BR> I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way! <BR> WHY? <BR> Because I'm going to get my father!"
144,Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want? <BR> Nothing. Are you alright? <BR> Sure I'm alright.  <BR> I'll go then.
145,Thanks Dad.  I'll call you. <BR> You have everything Kimberly? Credit card cell phone AAA card? <BR> Relax Dad.  It's Daytona not Mongolia. <BR> Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
146,You like music? <BR> Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might -- <BR> A man might what? <BR> I don't know -- I'd like to do anything -- <BR> Oh -- you would!
147,what a pleasure Governor.  Welcome. <BR> Hi Grierson forgive the war paint.  Going on To my regiment/s reunion after. <BR> Not at all Governor.  Very striking.
148,Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers! <BR> Awright go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya! <BR> But what about this? <BR> I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
149,All right what's your husband's first name? <BR> Hollis. Hollis Mulwray. <BR> Water and Power?
150,Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house.... <BR> I called her sister Mr. Lowery where she works the Music Makers Music Store you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do. <BR> You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone... <BR> Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
151,What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate just like the old times Sunshine. <BR> Those days are over Gordon. They were over a long time ago. <BR> Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought.
152,Mr Rothstein sir let me put her on suspension. <BR> Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'. <BR> Well sir I was just... <BR> Why is she eight pounds over? <BR> ...trying to offer you the respect that your... <BR> I... <BR> ...position... <BR> 'Mr Rothstein' is good enough. <BR> Mr Rothstein... well sometimes when you reach that pressure point when you put that pressure point on them you know it shows... <BR> She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen... <BR> ...and she doesn't always - <BR> ...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer. <BR> But sir. Well I don't know why. I guess maybe because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired. <BR> That's right. She will get fired. In fact I want you to send her back to Paris. <BR> It's always been our policy - <BR> No. Just stop everything.
153,Huh... I guess you aint quite ready for civilisation yet... Ill give you one more day a meal and then youre on your way. <BR> Los Angeles? <BR> Los Angeles is 100 miles away. <BR> Id appreciate it if I could use your phone. <BR> Im sure you would. But if I had one I wouldnt let you near it. Now you tuck back in and rest until youre told otherwise.  And for what its worth I wouldnt try anything that might be construed as unappreciative of my hospitality. Id sooner shoot you than have you upset me...
154,"Do they know? <BR> Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him. <BR> Who? <BR> Kurtzweil, we think."
155,Hi Gale any leads? <BR> Tons and tons. <BR> Where is Sidney's father? <BR> Home--where he lives. <BR> And are the police sure about that? <BR> Why don't you ask them? <BR> Already did. He's the perfect suspect don't you think? <BR> No I don't. <BR> Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home. <BR> Look I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
156,Well maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver. <BR> There are ads? For parents? <BR>  <BR> Come on Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
157,Is it weird? <BR> The mark? Yes. <BR> If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley... <BR> Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
158,Sweetie you've got lots of fans we've done market studies.  You rate right up there.  We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove. <BR> What? <BR> I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry? <BR> Yes but... <BR> We'll work something out.  I'm sure you'll be happy with it.
159,You are truly magnificent! <BR> Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
160,Leave me alone! <BR> Dad says you're late again you butthole! <BR> Leave me alone. <BR> Dad says!
161,I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there? <BR> They sound like finches. <BR> They could be finches. I don't know. We should go before it gets dark.
162,Well that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi. <BR> O-kay you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
163,Get out of here! <BR> Wait a minute GordonI <BR> Get out!
164,I don't want to cause any trouble. <BR> I'm here aren't I? <BR> I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon. <BR> Ooooo you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
165,Look you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so. <BR> Listen I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow? <BR> I'm on deadline.
166,"They got to stop <U>sometime</U>...if they're human at all, they got to stop! <BR> Naw...a human man rides a horse till it dies...then he goes on afoot...A Comanche comes along...gets that horse up...and rides it twenty more miles...Then he eats it."
167,Your mom take anything before this happened? <BR> Yeah but I don't know what. <BR> [Beat] What's your name? <BR> Jackie.
168,I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before you know I can feel completely free to be myself. <BR> We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty. <BR> What do we want? <BR> Mystery. Deception. <BR> Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy. <BR> What's sexy? <BR> Knowing who a person is. Down deep. <BR> Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking? <BR> You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?
169,Just a lot of crazy shit. <BR> Yeah? <BR> Yeah. Have you seen Telly around? <BR> Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper they all just almost killed some kid. <BR> What happened? <BR> I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit. <BR> Do you know where he went? <BR> I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now. <BR> Who Benny's little sister? <BR> Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'?
170,Here's yours. <BR> There's been a slight problem. <BR> What's that?
171,I don't think this is gold. <BR> Not as single-minded as the others not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
172,What do you think you're doing? <BR> You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how why... ? <BR> How deluded can you be?  There's no <u>why</u>... <BR> Who's responsible?! <BR> It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal... <BR> You call them...

179,Did you bring investment advice for me tonight?  It was tax shelters wasn't it?  Swiss debenture-swaps. <BR> MPG Capital. <BR> I think investment advice from a dead man it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead? <BR> It's a lot more stressful than I thought.
180,It's okay...It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama. <BR> No it's not okay. It's not.

To deny;  There <u>is</u> no report of Albanian Activity.  They have to deny it. Now, get the C.I.A."
191,"Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room? <BR> I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you."

Seven can go. <BR> This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
194,I thought you had to get to Miami. <BR> There's always a later plane. <BR> You're a sex junkie you know that Carl? <BR> Nobody's perfect.  I'm glad you're out of it Hannah-- you're a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper.
195,I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors. <BR> Clean up?  I don't...
196,We must have been heroic. <BR> Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle. <BR> Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?' <BR> You know the answer to that. <BR> I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's. <BR> They're only gonna lose. <BR> Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand? <BR> The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.
197,Oh poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you. <BR> What?
198,He didn't see you did he? <BR> No. <BR> See right now he doesn't know that I know that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way! <BR> This is insane!
199,Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples we don't need! <BR> He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them too. <BR> I wouldn't worry Edna that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry he can pick his dinner!
200,Where are you going? <BR> I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there. <BR> What are you going to do? <BR> Hey I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast.  I can handle these clowns.  I want to talk to Hans.  Hans! Sprickenzie talk?
201,No I think it's better if you just stay here to heal. At least a week. <BR> I'm going. <BR> Quiet or I'll sew up your mouth too.
202,Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park. <BR> Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!
203,Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time. <BR> Yeah. <BR> But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good. <BR> How did she smell? Did her puss stink?
204,I think it's funny. <BR> Me too. I'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.
205,Jack's sort of sensitive I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks. <BR> There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it actually. <BR> I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her... <BR> I'm sure I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did. <BR> ...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid but it's like when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore he changed. Now he's like everyone else. <BR> I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose. <BR> Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that shoot Twombley on purpose?
206,Right. Something black though. <BR> I'll buy that. Black's always good. <BR> We did talk about Naomi. <BR> I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure. <BR> I'm sure I said. <BR> But you weren't. I could tell. <BR> I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long silences.
207,"To my triumph, of course. <BR> Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette."
208,I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear! <BR> The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day.
209,<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>?? <BR> Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper. <BR> I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>! <BR> Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
210,Yes. <BR> What is it? <BR> You want -- <BR> Not you. I want Ricky to answer.
211,I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened? <BR> We just have to make a new beginning. <BR> Cherry-red Tears. <BR> What? <BR> Cherry-red Tears your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair. <BR> Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store. <BR> I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you. <BR> 
212,Shut up Kevin. <BR> NO seriously - I know he's your boyfriend but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes resting. <BR> You know the thing I hate most about children? <BR> Nope. <BR> You.
213,Without the glasses you're not even ugly.  I don't need them because I never read. How do I look. <BR> Like Clark Kent.  Now Superman.
214,...Her brother usually goes with her but he's in county unexpectedly. <BR> What for? <BR> Traffic tickets gone to warrant. They stopped him for something found the warrants on 'im took 'im to jail. She doesn't want to walk around alone with all that weed. Well I don't wanna do this I have a bad feeling about it but she keeps askin' me keeps askin' me finally I said okay 'cause I'm sick of listening to it. Well we're picking this guy up at the train station.
215,Chalk up one for your side. Now listen you want to get to King Westley don't you?  All right I'm here to help you. What I want is your story exclusive. A day-to- day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it. <BR> Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out for yourself including this. <BR> This?  Oh that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you wifey dear but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments.  <BR> Well thank you. Thank you very much but you've been very kind.  <BR> Oh yeah? It's all right with me. Go on out in the storm but I'm going to follow you see?  Yeah. And if you get tough I'll just have to turn you over to your old man right now. Savvy?  Now that's my whole plot in a nutshell. A simple story for simple people. Now if you behave yourself I'll see that you get to King Westley; if not I'll just have to spill the beans to papa. Now which of these beds do you prefer? This one? All right.
216,Oh.  The navigator just came in - we're ready to cast off. <BR> Well anchors aweigh you have a bon voyage.  And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding we'll be through here in a couple of weeks. <BR> Goodbye my darling.
217,Yeah that works out. <BR> But how much cash could I bury in my closet right? <BR> You need to understand and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss. <BR> Oh listen I understand that there's always a risk... you know I might have to take a loss somewhere. <BR> So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker. <BR> I mean you will try to push it through won't you Mr Clark? <BR> Yes. <BR> Well you gotta understand I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
218,You goin' home? <BR> Yeah... You want a ride... <BR> Sure - <BR> How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ? <BR> Hell no. I boosted a 'Vette. <BR> You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it? <BR> I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back... <BR> Damn crooks is everywhere --
219,It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ... <BR> I don't think so Detective ...
220,To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag! <BR> That's sick Dante.
221,Don't screw around man pull it! <BR> You do it... you first! <BR> One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord! <BR> You first! <BR> Okay!
222,Look I'm just on this boat okay? I'm an engineer.  Whatever this is it's not for me to be involved okay? <BR> I don't remember Zurich.
223,I mean listen two people don't get along at some point you gotta call it... I mean it's none of my business but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere - <BR> Oh you're right I know.  It's... well I was just - <BR> What? What? <BR> Nothin'. <BR> What were you gonna say? Go ahead. <BR> I don't -  <BR> Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead. <BR> Yeah? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Well I was thinkin' maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out. <BR> Let me think about that. <BR> Okay. <BR> See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust. <BR> Mm-hm. <BR> You know? <BR> Yeah. 'Cause you know  He's never gonna give me my jewelry. <BR> Hm. <BR> He holds that key so tight he's probably got it stuck up his ass. <BR> Yeah right. That's Sammy. And he's probably got it there too.
224,A little. Not much. <BR> This way gentlemen. Let's retire to my office shall we?
225,We have a commission. If there's a dispute over territory the commission decides. <BR> Tell me something Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon? <BR> The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon. <BR> Hey I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention. <BR> Boo-Boo. <BR> Not another word.
226,I remember. Supper getting cold cos you two are out there heads under hoods ... <BR> You remember that Kip?
227,Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles. <BR> He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder. <BR> Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il signor Ripley ha visto il signor Greenleaf? 
228,What's the rush John Henry? <BR> I ain't John Henry. <BR> Good. <BR> What's your fuckin' problem anyway?
229,You know anything about the stations here? <BR> It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix. <BR> All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A. <BR> Did an exploratory and according to them she needed an overhaul.
230,It's in the bible see. You better go buy him a present. Please Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff his favorite and hard to get. <BR> Stay here I'll see what I can do.
231,Piss painting? <BR> I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green. <BR> How come you're not peeing on them yourself? <BR> I don't like beer.
232,aybe we ought to postpone the opening. <BR> Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted. <BR> appreciate that Sidney. But our leading man can't remember his lines. And his understudy can't carry the play.
233,What's this? <BR> It's nothing. I burnt myself. <BR> That's not a burn. <BR> It is. I did it cooking.
234,Fredrica Bimmel from Belvedere Ohio. The first girl taken but the third body found... Why? <BR> 'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down. <BR> But why? He didn't weight the others.
235,Oh I couldn't copy your work. <BR> But you copy my work every week. <BR> Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner huh? <BR> I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table. <BR> Charisma? <BR> Or something.
236,What choice did I have -- ?! <BR> You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?! <BR> I only protect myself -- ! <BR> You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills -- <BR> If I'm a hunter it's because you taught me to be!
237,Pretty radical Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it? <BR> No games Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!! <BR> Naw you pull it!
238,You're behind the times Jake. They've got steam irons now.  And I'm out of Chinatown. <BR> Since when? <BR> Since I made Lieutenant.
239,Right now I'd even welcome trouble. <BR> You've got a hormone deficiency. <BR> How can you tell that from a thermometer! <BR> Those sultry sun-worshipers you watch haven't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks.
240,I'm okay. I just lost my balance. <BR> I put you on the floor. <BR> Oh. <BR> I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her huh?
241,Theo. <BR> Theo! This is Sheila Kastle my partner's daughter.
242,What's it like to shoot somebody? <BR> I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.
243,Dick you should call Bobby. <BR> He doesn't want me at the funeral. <BR> You don't have to go. <BR> De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there. <BR> Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight. <BR> No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me. <BR> They've lost a brother.  You know what that means Dick.
244,"Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady. <BR> What's your being married got to do with it? <BR> It means I've finally got a life to live! I don't have to play parts I'm too old for - just because I've got nothing to do with my nights!  I know you've made plans. I'll make it up to you, believe me. I'll tour a year with this one, anything - only you do understand - don't you, Lloyd?"
245,I thought you'd like this.  Best thing I ever did.  If you don't want to do it DON'T... <BR> I'll call them okay? <BR> It doesn't matter... <BR> I'm going to call. <BR> Do it for YOU. <BR> Okay okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises. <BR> I know...
246,His wife. This guy says she was kidnapped last Wednesday. <BR> The day of our homicides. <BR> Yah.
247,"Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden. <BR> That's it! YOU'RE GONE!"
248,It's okay everything's okay now. <BR> He's dead...?
249,I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give you a job. Nothing permanent mind you but that upstairs room over there  -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk in there for twenty years and it's time it got cleaned up. <BR> What's your offer? <BR> Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today you can do the rest tomorrow. <BR> Is there a benefits package or are you hiring me on a freelance basis? <BR> Benefits? <BR> You know health insurance dental plan paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights. <BR> I'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly freelance basis. <BR> Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it. <BR> The name is Cyrus Cole. <BR> Paul. Paul Benjamin.
250,Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here? <BR> I must have made a mistake. <BR> Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake.   Stay here... Give me that money.
251,Are you alright young man? <BR> I think so thank you so much ...
252,-me my God it's a great day! <BR> Hey can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
253,Male or female? <BR> Female. <BR> At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
254,Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you. <BR> No.
255,You're never going to marry? <BR> Probably. But when I do it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress a lobster dinner and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere do anything and love it.
256,Don't worry Charles.  If God is still with her she will be victorious.  We're not her judges... we're just spectators.  Let her go to Compiegne as you let her go to Orleans and let God decide her fate. <BR> But... her army's so small now... <BR> Then her faith will have to be bigger.
257,Afraid so. <BR> That's a big book you're writing. <BR> I think it's sort of writing itself at this point. <BR> Wow Hannah always swore you were working but -- <BR> But... ? <BR> Nothing it's just that well it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were... <BR> Washed up? <BR> Blocked. <BR> Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.
258,He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information. <BR> Let's go.
259,And you still believe he's going to come here? <BR> Based on what we know of him that would seem inevitable. <BR> Do you think she loves him? <BR> She must feel something for him. After all she and I did create him.
260,We were set up the cops were waiting for us. <BR> What? Nobody set anybody up. <BR> The cops were there waitin' for us! <BR> Bullshit. <BR> Hey fuck you man you weren't there we were. And I'm tellin' ya the cops had that store staked out. <BR> Okay Mr. Detective who did it? <BR> What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other? <BR> And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up? <BR> I don't know but somebody did. <BR> Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show and you wonder why cops show up.
261,I don't mind waiting. <BR> Well there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that. <BR> Well I can help. <BR> I said NO!
262,Tom where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance isn't it? <BR> Look out!
263,I'll get it. <BR> Who's up for a night on the town.
264,About Brad's family? <BR> As Janet's parents this should be really easy.  Your last clue... Mental Instability.  You have thirty seconds.
265,Oh she may get wooly women do get wooly because of all the stress... <BR> Gimme that.
266,So what are you going to do? <BR> I'm going to drink my coffee. Then we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers loss of job house humiliation gutter press and probably prison. <BR> They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank. <BR> Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me. <BR> Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute. <BR> Well as it turns out I did.
267,Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick runs like a rat tough for one person but with two of us-- <BR> Okay whatta I do? <BR> If he sees me he'll run so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him. <BR> That's ridiculous. <BR> Believe me it always works. The simpler the better. <BR> You learn that in the army?
268,I don't get it... this really was my turf... <BR> You're not a kid anymore. <BR> 
269,You...you're an American? <BR> Only if New Jersey counts.
270,I should butcher all and every one of them. Merlin what is this wagging of tongues? <BR> Just show the sword.
271,He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula.  I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me. <BR> Don't you worry. We'll get some action.
272,All summer? <BR> He wanted a job he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
273,As little as possible. <BR> The District Attorney gives his men advice like that? <BR> They do in Chinatown.
274,Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends. <BR> Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry once the others are dead it'll come back for you.  Always does. <BR> That still doesn't make sense.  You said you die in the same order you were originally meant to.  But Evan Shaeffer died last in my premonition not first.
275,You know damn well I was at that dinner and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!  Well tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much.  Give me that much at least! <BR> Yes you were.
276,Let's not say anything to my mother about this Mr. Carpenter. <BR> Why not Bobby? <BR> She doesn't like me to steal from people.
277,Look! Police! <BR> I know. I called them. <BR> Shouldn't we --
278,What's this? <BR> Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit but it's for your own growth brah.  Press play.
279,Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now. <BR> What is it? . . . Billy? <BR> For Christ's sake just GET on the plane okay!
280,Yeah we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us. <BR> They payin'? <BR> How did Nicky collect?
281, <BR> Where does it say that? <BR> On the side of that one truck.
282,Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks. <BR> ... Dad you should've been a CEO. How about dinner? <BR> Whatever night you like. <BR> Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday. <BR> Yeah you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here. <BR> ...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking you hear?
283,Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello?? <BR> Pritchett take it down a couple hundred decibels what is your problem? <BR> Problem? No problem -- just want to get my money and get on home -- you know things to see people to do?
284,How could you possibly? <BR> Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you but I always did.
285,What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising! <BR> Well baby I do but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
286,Another summer of working at Swenson's. <BR> Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open. <BR> You know Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex. <BR> What do you want? <BR> I want romance. <BR> Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
287,MacKenzie [beat] what if we are crazy? <BR> [Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3. <BR> Becker does? Are you sure? <BR> I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
288,Class schedule map book list. <BR> Has Warner Huntington checked in yet? <BR> Uh no. Maybe you should try the Lido deck.
289,This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical. <BR> How's that possible? <BR> Jason's asleep... maybe he's dreaming of himself as a young boy... and that boy is sitting right here.  I think he's some kind of projection from Jason's subconscious.
290,Ace saw Vegas one way. <BR> You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'? <BR> Of course.
291,Where's Dickie's father? <BR> He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.
292,It's okay Kanita. Come on in. <BR> He looks like a cop. <BR> He's not a cop he's a medic.  I'm CY Coates.
293,Couldn't turn down the job huh? A girl could get hurt this way. <BR> Yeah. Deja vu. <BR> What do you say? Let's head for the lights.
294, <BR> I don't know nobody does.  I'm an employee. <BR> Then what good are you? <BR> I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning. <BR> That's a lie... <BR> Yeah?  I was your waitress on your birthday.  Connie told you about C.R.S. that day remember?  I was already playing my part <u>before</u> you started the game.
295,I've been ok. <BR> Good. How's your mom? <BR> Ok I guess.
296,Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls girls who faced their responsibilities who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you? <BR> I... <BR> What did you think that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer?
297,If you've got a gun on you Price I'd hand it over now. <BR> Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement? <BR> Fascinated. <BR> I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.
298,I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere. <BR> I pay too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms. <BR> A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries the alimony stops... and then... <BR> I haven't even been married once yet! <BR> Yeah but when you do... you'll swing. <BR> Sam let's go get married. <BR> And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money you can lick the stamps. <BR> I'll lick the stamps.
299,Fun?  What's he know about fun?  Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat. <BR> Shake off the pitch.  Throw what you wanta.
300,Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker? <BR> Could explain why Fleming was there.

302, <BR> February first. <BR> The same day she supposedly went down. <BR> Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
303,Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ... <BR> How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...? <BR> After a while it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ... <BR> Thank-you ... <BR> De nada ...
304,"Miss Caswell got lucky too late. The audition is over. <BR> Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max. <BR> The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four. <BR> Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who? <BR> Naturally enough, your understudy. <BR> I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy- <BR> I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington. <BR> Eve! My understudy... <BR> Didn't you know? <BR> Of course I knew. <BR> It just slipped your mind."
305,Elena. Elena Hood am I right? <BR> Yes. <BR> Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year. <BR> Yes it was -- I ended up -- <BR> No need to make excuses --
306,I don't get it. <BR> How do you not tread on the earth? I mean you kind of have to.
307,Which one can I open first? <BR> Let's let Molly open one.
308,What are you gonna do call him up and ask him to give us back our shit? <BR> Did he bring that with him?
309,Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue. <BR> Oh. Goodness. <BR> You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do! <BR> Like what? <BR> Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.
310,I had it all on tape... <BR> What did you do then? <BR> I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you. <BR> What happened with the tape? <BR> I took it with me.  It's in a safe place. <BR> So you know about Marvosa and Stanton and all of them.
311,Watch out man. You'll get yourself killed like that. <BR> I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ... <BR> No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going. <BR> No wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life. <BR> I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time. <BR> I owe you something. <BR> It's okay mister. No big deal. <BR> Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years. <BR> Well if you put it that way... <BR> You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance. <BR> That's all right. If I think of something I'll send my butler over to tell you. <BR> Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee. <BR> I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand since you insist if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no. <BR> Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul. <BR> Rashid. Rashid Cole. 
312,Yes. <BR> I'll be there in three hours. <BR> Don't speed Chase.  It's not...
313,We should drown that damn Jack in the vat! <BR> Now now darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in. <BR> Yeah you really showed him Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off and all you cut off *him* was his clothes! <BR> You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right Homer?
314,I shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself a mind! Just when exactly does an actress decide they're her words she's saying and her thoughts she's expressing? <BR> Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater! <BR> It's about time the piano realized it has not written the concerto!
315,No I'm not kidding you <u>Philip</u>. <BR> What next?!  -- A strange bra under my pillow!
316,But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here? <BR> White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
317,I swear Satch. <BR> Uh huh...  Uh huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in? <BR> As nuts as that sounds yes. <BR> Uh huh. <BR> Satch would you listen to me here.  Just you and me.  Can I talk to you here alone?
318,Hello Jake. <BR> How are you Lou? <BR> I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that I'm fine. <BR> Summer colds are the worst. <BR> Yeah they are.
319,This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now. <BR>  <BR> The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500. <BR>  <BR> 
320,In this rat race everybody's guilty till they're proved innocent! One of the differences between the Theater and civilization...  ... what gets me is how all of those papers in town happened to catch that particular performance! <BR> Lloyd says it's a publicity release... <BR> The little witch must have had Indians runners out snatching critics out of bars steam rooms and museums or wherever they hole up... well she won't get away with it! Nor will Addison deWitt and his poison pen! If Equity or my lawyer can't or won't do anything about it I will personally stuff that pathetic little lost lamb down Mr. deWitt's ugly throat...
321,They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks and we can pretend it never happened. <BR> You're pregnant? <BR> I'm so sorry you guys. If it's any consolation I have heartburn that's like radiating down to my kneecaps and I haven't gone number two since Wednesday. Morning!
322,...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat. <BR> I think you're in anaphylactic shock -- <BR> No -- it's --
323,Just so you know if you're gonna burn me on the money you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car. <BR> I know that.
324,What are you talking about? <BR> I lost you. <BR> What? <BR> I never knew you Dad. <BR> Why? <BR> Fire. <BR> On the job? <BR> It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right you would've made it. <BR> That can't be...that's not gonna happen. <BR> It did Pop.  It did. <BR> When? <BR> October 12 1969.
325,Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking. <BR> So then you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
326,Well how come I laid nine? <BR> 'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
327,Mom... <BR> Yes hon? <BR> If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me right? <BR> Sure hon. Goodnight.
328,But you're sure? <BR> He was at the campground yesterday. <BR> So... <BR> It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
329,Okay Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit? <BR> I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public when their bitches get 'em home they chill the fuck out. <BR> Not these guys. <BR> Yeah those guys too.
330,Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it! <BR> Elbow. <BR> Wow! It's magical.
331,How much did you pay? <BR> I don't know. <BR> How much did you pay? <BR> I don't know. <BR> How much? <BR> I don't know.
332,I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you please? <BR> Jack Gordon. <BR> Mr. Gordon did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman? <BR> No. Wait... Was she a great fat person? I may have seen her I'm not sure...
333,Peanuts? <BR> Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
334,<u>Was this a game or a fuck up</u>? <BR> I don't know. <BR> Get the kids out!
335,Remember we had that thing. <BR> What thing? <BR> Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were- <BR> Thing? <BR> yes we had uh... <BR> Oh the thing! Oh the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
336,Goodbye Grady. <BR> No. Sara you don't understand... <BR> Trust me I understand. I just want to say something to you Grady. <BR> Yea? <BR> How you choose to live your own life is your business. But you be careful with that boy Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else.
337,Shoes too? <BR> You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry. <BR> Get undressed in your own room would you? <BR> I thought you'd missed the train. <BR> Freddie drove me back in his car. <BR> Is Freddie here? <BR> He's downstairs. <BR> I was just fooling around. Don't say anything. Sorry.
338,Who? <BR> Rajeev the man who usually works on the building. <BR> Oh he went home to India but as far as I know he'll be back.
339,Wait wait... <BR> For what? <BR> Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor but... I mean you don't understand... to them you're a witch working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you? <BR> Because if they don't I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever! <BR> Well.  I'd love to see that but after taking counsel with my captains I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything. <BR> You may have been with your counsel but I've been with mine and I'm telling you God's counsel is wiser than yours and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now! <BR> Fine -- go now if you want but not with me!  You may have a duty to God but I have a duty to my people and my people are starving!  So right now I'm going to take the food back to the city and if you can please calm down and let me accompany you to Orleans it will be my honor to welcome you.
340,Money. <BR> Jack doesn't need money. <BR> Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that. <BR> Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides who would pay him? <BR> Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley Boston union official probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia. <BR> The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt? <BR> No I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age. <BR> You wouldn't have done anything like that shot someone for money. <BR> No. Not for money. But if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up you know. <BR> But not now.
341,Tommy Reina's gone over to Maranzano but so far Masseria ain't lifted a finger <BR> The fat man's scared. Scared of us and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us. <BR> We can get the war started tomorrow but it won't be pretty. <BR> Who? <BR> Tommy Reina.
342,What does that mean? No I know that look. What does that mean? <BR> It means I got the money. <BR> You got money. That's a - That's a good look.
343, <BR>  <BR> Getting off on the inaugural?  Gonna go... <BR> Might if I was asked... 
344,But I thought I don't know I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it. <BR> But I don't know maybe we're the normal ones y'know? I mean what kind of people do well at this stuff? <BR> And I just liked you so much. <BR> You did? You liked me?
345,Shut up! You hear me!! <BR> ...we gotta get outta here -- NOW. <BR> Shut up man just shut the hell up! I gotta think! I gotta think!!
346,The floor was wet. She slipped! <BR> Why was the floor wet? <BR> I don't know why the floor was wet! <BR> Why?!
347,All right. <BR> Okay? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you? <BR> I'm here. <BR> No you're not. Where are you? Where are you? <BR> I'm always here for you. <BR> You are. <BR> I am.
348,Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut. <BR> I beg your pardon. <BR> Unconscious. You know when you don't know anything. Your natural state. There are some people - you can't buy their self-respect for a bucket of shekels - well I happen to be one of those guys.
349,My... visions... <BR> They're going to come and visit you in here? <BR> Yes... that's what I pray for...! <BR> I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you. <BR> No no -- you can't stay or they won't come! <BR> Why not? <BR> Because... I have to be alone!
350,Recluse. Kinder word. <BR> You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
351,I'm just glad we're still together Lisa because I need you this year. <BR> Look Brad I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free and meet some new people. Then if we get back together we'll know it's the right thing.
352,That's not a satisfactory answer. <BR> Look save it for somebody else will ya.  This ancient shit doesn't have anything to do with me.
353,Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings. <BR> You're a lucky guy. <BR> She really loves me.
354,I think we should have taken a right back there. <BR> Back where?
355,Burned out.  I need a vacation. <BR> Too much glamor huh.  What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo?  Apes in Kenya?
356,Dick -- you've got to hear this! <BR> Listen just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and frankly once is enough in anyone's life.
357,Uh... the admitting nurse... <BR> What did she do? <BR> She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...' <BR> The 'History'...? <BR> How old are you how many children... when did you last eat...
358,You are late -- the dancer's gone to the theatre. <BR> Well? <BR> She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know? <BR> Yes. <BR> And what are you going to do? <BR> The pearls are in her room. <BR> Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today they think you're scared. <BR> I've been careful I've been waiting my chance. <BR> You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you. <BR> I told you I'll get the pearls tonight. <BR> Need any help? <BR> No. <BR> Have you got that skeleton key?
359,What're those? <BR> Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification. <BR> What for? <BR> [Beat] In case you get lost or can't remember who you are.
360,I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him. <BR> What do you want now? <BR> Guns.   Can you get them? <BR> Man I can get anything. <BR> Don't bullshit me. <BR> I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible? <BR> I've got a way with people. <BR> I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya? <BR> I'm from Belgium. <BR> Yeah I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you. <BR> Why haven't you turned us in? <BR> I ain't no rat.  You got money right?
361,Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie. <BR> June July ... August? <BR> The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined. <BR> Any other vices? <BR> All of a piece really. A fanatical weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.  British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British weather has been tampered with by ... aliens.
362,Do you mind joining the Israelites? <BR> You're not really serious about this are you? <BR> All right don't join the Israelites. Perhaps you're interested in how a man undresses.  Funny thing about that. Quite a study in psychology. No two men do it alike. 
363,See you soon Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details. <BR> Next week.
364,So where are you from? <BR> Up north. <BR> Where up north? <BR> Seattle. <BR> You got any family?

368,Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being? <BR> Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
369,This is still a script we're talking about right? <BR> I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
370,We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall. <BR> I think not.
371,I've got some terrific news about your friend Mr. Carpenter. <BR> What about him? <BR> Helen he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money? <BR> All right Tom -- it's true. I know it's true. <BR> How do you know? <BR> Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody. <BR> Are you crazy? After what happened today? <BR> You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is. <BR> Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it. <BR> That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me Tom I know what I'm talking about. <BR> He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in. <BR> But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for. <BR> He told you... Don't be silly honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket. <BR> Is that what you're thinking about? <BR> Why not? Somebody's got to get rid of him.
372,Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing? <BR> With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
373,Dad stop it! <BR> Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
374,And the January Semi-formal -- <BR> Okay!  Look Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses that's fine.  But personally I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do.
375,When the two of you held each other. When you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine. When your parents were out and the two of you were alone... completely alone in that big house. <BR> It was a small house. <BR> All right. A small house... with small rooms. <BR> I smelled her hair. That's it. I just liked smelling her hair.
376,Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter. <BR> The lab made three possible matches this was one of 'em.
377,I told ya he'd be pissed. <BR> What are you gonna do about him?
378,I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive... <BR> Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive... <BR> She's alive...Better she's alive and livin' with Comanches than her brains bashed out...
379,No. <BR> Well you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking! <BR> Cool it. <BR> First things first we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally they'll do incredible things for your nails so that's a plus. Oh and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver. <BR> 
380,You must take the oath!  Not even a king would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith. <BR> I will willingly swear to tell you what I am allowed to tell you but as to the rest even if you threaten to cut off my head I still won't tell you.
381,What'd he say? <BR> What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride. <BR> What'd you say? <BR> I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
382,Look I quit! <BR> Yeah? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Yeah? <BR> You're always picking on me. It took me three hours to get those little gadgets in those holes and you screw it up in a minute. Hey look!
383,No you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to. <BR> You don't have to go if you don't want to... <BR> But I do want to.
384,All this apparatus Vicki... This house and the money and the power ... It was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited.  All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened. <BR> I'm frightened of you Bruce. I'm frightened for you. <BR> In all these years... Why couldn't I see how it wold turn out?
385,"And you're sure it was a woman? <BR> God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know."
386,Eating solid breakfasts Utah? <BR> Sir? <BR> All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor cigarettes... <BR> I take the skin off chicken.
387,No. <BR> They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!
388,Merlin tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me... <BR> What is it my child?
389,Don't ever trust them.  They never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  Vietnamese are like Russians.  Both are dogs. <BR> Mr. Chairman there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend. <BR> That has the added virtue of being true.
390,I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him? <BR> So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up. <BR> Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay first things fucking last where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them. <BR> I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station. <BR> Well let's go get it. We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside.  You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop.  You two take a car each I'll follow ya. You ditch it I'll pick you up then we'll pick up the stones. And while I'm following you I'll arrange for some sort of a doctor for our friend.
391,Well one way or the other Kent State is not good.  We have to get out in front of this thing.  The PR is going to murder us. <BR> Money.  Follow the money. <BR> Sir? <BR> These kids are being manipulated by the Communists.  Like Chambers and Hiss.
392,What do I have to do for it? <BR> Nothing Wade I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little. <BR> I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning. <BR> So? <BR> He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it. <BR> Wade that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me. <BR> You? Why? <BR> Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal. <BR> That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew. <BR> What's the difference? Take my truck take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there? <BR> Want to buy? <BR> Don't light that in here. I'm allergic. <BR> I won't. You interested? <BR> Maybe. <BR> You and Mel Gordon? <BR> Could be. <BR> Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.
393,Eto Akta Gamat! <BR> I'm sorry it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently so I figured...
394,This is a Lifestyles hotel. <BR> What? <BR>  <BR> Are you sure? <BR> Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here. <BR> Well we're here.  And more importantly he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
395,Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police -- <BR> 
396,I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs. <BR> You are going where? <BR> Crosstown. <BR> Very bad today.
397,Where am I? <BR> Ramstein Air Base Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
398,You're all safe. Thanks be to God! <BR> Later David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
399,Gun shot. <BR> Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown? <BR> Dead. <BR> Goddamn goddamn! How did he die? <BR> How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him. <BR> Oh this is bad this is so bad.  Is it bad? <BR> As opposed to good? <BR> This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time. <BR> You really think we were set up? <BR> You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up I know we got set up! I mean really seriously where did all those cops come from huh? One minute they're not there the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off okay. Okay when an alarm goes off you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street at that particular moment you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this? <BR> I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away I've just been dealin' with him. <BR> Well you better start thinking about it. Cause I sure as fuck am thinking about it. In fact that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know there's cops driving fast on their way here now. <BR> Let's go in the other room...
400,Next week. <BR> You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?
401,I never promised you anything. <BR> How could you let her see this? <BR> Goodbye Bobby. <BR> Just so you know I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can. <BR> Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am. <BR> Tell you the truth I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special and you're gonna fuck her up.
402,You brought the army into Rome. <BR> I was summoned. <BR> It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons. <BR> It's my job to keep my job.  And that by the way is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired. <BR> Quintus you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate! <BR> You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses! <BR> Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators... <BR> The 'people'? listen to the people they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
403,A hundred-seven bucks too much. Any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to Moliari. <BR> Ya mean we're so rich we're broke?
404,"Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way... <BR> You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!"
405,How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox. <BR> So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these how'd you get these? 
406,Look I don't know what's up there. <BR> You got me pretty fucking curious. <BR> Look you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait. <BR> Nah...  With you I mean you'd probably just forget about me right? <BR> How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
407,You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off? <BR> No no. I - I'd I'd - pay you back the principal and interest heck I'd go - one over prime -
408,I've been doing all the talking so far haven't I? <BR> Yes. <BR> I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are doing all the listening!  You are alone here aren't you?  It would drive me crazy. <BR> That would be a rather extreme reaction wouldn't it? <BR> Just an expression...  What I meant was... I'd do just about anything... to get away.  Wouldn't you?
409,Maybe the antenna's broken. <BR> We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
410,Nah.  Maybe. <BR> What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me? <BR> Well we are trying to ruin his life. <BR> It's nothing personal though.  <BR> What's the matter? <BR> Same as Magruder I don't like it when they turn out to be human. <BR> I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun. <BR> Maybe we are...
411,What are you doing? <BR> I got to go. <BR> What? <BR> I'm worried about someone.
412,How do we get to the vault door? <BR> There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
413,Hi. I'm inquiring ...well I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive. <BR> Yes there was. <BR> Can you tell me what happened? <BR> No. I can't. <BR> Was anyone hurt? <BR> May I have your name please?
414,Thank you.  I'll tell him. <BR> For me? <BR> Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora presently in the Antarctic Ocean and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring. <BR> Damn.
415,I was hoping DU.  Bean might take a look at my computer project today. <BR> Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy you know? <BR> Howls he getting on with the family? <BR> Ah. Fine.  It's good.  It's great.
416,Flaemmchen what are you doing here in the middle of the night. <BR> Looking for my room -- one sixty- six. <BR> You live here? <BR> For tonight.  <BR> Oh! <BR> Yes -- oh! <BR> Well -- such is life Flaemmchen. <BR> And Baron thanks so much for everything.
417,Hey there Nickie. <BR> Conrad what a surprise.  Gesundheit. <BR> Happy Birthday man. <BR>  <BR> That's why it's a classic.  Come on man... how 'bout a hug... ?
418,I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal. <BR> Hear what? <BR> That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth. <BR> Now?
419,Coffee's perked. <BR> When did she die? <BR> Is...? She's dead then?
420,Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum.  If it's my father they want then give him to them! <BR> Yes.  You know that's not a bad idea. <BR> Maybe it'll crush Gaius. <BR> I'm serious. <BR> So am I. <BR> We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food. <BR> Give away food? <BR> Sacks of grain even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube. <BR> Take grain away from the army? <BR> Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
421,You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice. <BR> Thank you but I hardly think -- <BR> -- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
422,If she comes over here Max my brain is going to turn into guacamole. <BR> I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.
423,Hey Caesar where's the key? <BR> The key yeah the key's in my pants in the bathroom. <BR> Fuck it I don't need the key.
424,You dont know why hes come to Los Angeles?  The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his? <BR> No. A poor little rich boy who thought hed save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.
425,OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here. <BR> Shut up Boyd. <BR> Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior. <BR> He's having a problem here.
426,But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean they had bookies pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So I started getting everybody in line. Best of all for the first time in my life I figured out a way not to lose. <BR> Yeah he had a fool-proof scheme all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won he collected. When he lost he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
427,I wonder how he did it? <BR> Did what? <BR> I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?
428,Monkeybone? <BR> Left-handed he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff and make me laugh and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped. <BR> Wow - two guys in the same brain. - Which one did you fall in love with?
429,Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all did you? You haven't even been out of the house. <BR> Yes I have! <BR> You didn't really see the space ship. You just thought you did.
430,Oh Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France. <BR> Yeah I dig him. <BR> Although a cartoon I feel he shares a universal theme: We are all searching for love. No?
431,You made it! Hey that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So how'd it go today? You find him? <BR> Ummm... no no. Different 'Ravell.'
432,What'll it be sir? <BR> Booze. <BR> Sorry sir we only serve coffee. <BR> Coffee? <BR> Scotch coffee Canadian coffee sour-mash coffee... <BR> Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.
433,So many children. Are they all orphans? <BR> Well this *is* an orphanage.
434,Oh he-he didn't say anything. <BR> No no I came out here to get some shock therapy but there was an energy crisis so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met? <BR> Hi. How do you do.
435,Oh? <BR> Nellie baby I'll make it up to you. <BR> You're making it up pretty good so far. <BR> The minute we get a job I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
436,Who's this ? <BR> It's Grady Walter. <BR> Grady? <BR> GRADY Tripp. English Department. <BR> I know it's you Grady I just... Christ Grady do you know what time it is? <BR> I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right is it? <BR> It's three-thirty Grady. <BR> This is important. <BR> Oh? <BR> I... I... <BR> What is it Grady? <BR> I'm in love with your wife. <BR> Excuse me? <BR> Sara. I'm in love with her.
437,But it ain't runnin' away Ma. All I wanta do is go away with another fella an' look aroun' for work by ourself-- <BR> Well you ain't a-goin'! Ain't *nobody* else a-goin'! We *got* here an' we gonna *stay* here together! As long as we got the fambly unbroke I ain't scared but it's a long bitter road we got ahead of us--  --an' I'm here to tell ya ef anybody else tries to bust us up anymore I'm a-goin' cat wild with this here piece a bar-arn!
438,It's time somebody ate *them*. <BR> I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington! <BR> Daddy it's a letter to *me*. <BR> He mentions Homer too you know. <BR> 
439,So what do you think Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement haven't I? <BR> You see Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
440,That was fun.  What now? <BR> I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion. <BR> And you haven't called him?--
441,Ted have you lost your mind? <BR> You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone. <BR> I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS. <BR> But that smile. <BR> Oh Ted DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off. <BR> So you'll think about it?
442,I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy? <BR> I'm a fool. <BR> No no ...
443,What'd you say to him? <BR> I asked if we could give him anything else.
444,"Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after? <BR> Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines. <BR> Talk about Segretti-- <BR> --don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too. <BR> There were more then. <BR> Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere-- <BR> --the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation-- <BR> --don't you miss the grand scheme too. <BR> How grand? <BR> Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti. <BR> And Justice and FBI know all this? <BR> Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief. <BR> Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats? <BR> I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty..."
445, <BR> You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.
446,Maybe I should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it's like to sleep with you. <BR> They wouldn't know.
447,This is the baby sitter. <BR> Oh. When are they expected home? <BR> I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing. <BR> Well if he calls in tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him. <BR> Does he have your number Mr. Jefferies? <BR> He has it. Thank you. <BR> Goodnight.
448,Come on Bobby. Time to go to bed. <BR> Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station? <BR> I -- I don't know dear... Perhaps there's some mistake.
449,Shes pretty... See you huh? <BR> Bye bye Jane. And dont be naughty.
450,And... what does Jeanne think? <BR> I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this I'm just the messenger.
451,Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today? <BR> Gee -- I don't know... The space man I guess. <BR> I was speaking of earth men. I meant the greatest philosopher -- the greatest thinker.
452,Wait a minute why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country! <BR> I mean d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is M- Marshall McLuhan you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work! <BR>  <BR> Oh do yuh? <BR> Yes. <BR> Well that's funny because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so here just let me- I mean all right. Come over here... a second.
453,If two experts sign off on the island the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant. <BR> Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana. <BR> Why not? <BR> Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
454,I can wait around if you want. <BR> No. That's cool man.
455,Rising profits...strong balance sheets good earnings per share. <BR> So you're hot on this stock? <BR> It's ready to take off. I'd jump all over it if I were you.
456,No. That's Ray here. Ray... <BR> Ray Levoi Sir. Pleasure.
457,Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean is this like a hobby? <BR> Not exactly. <BR> They were vampires weren't they? <BR> Yeah. <BR> God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires.
458,Well apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust! <BR> Come on this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night even I hardly get any sleep.
459,... There can be no whitewash at the White House ... two wrongs do not make a right.  I love America.  God bless America and God bless each and every one of you. <BR> Sir ... six bodies.
460,Me and Jill we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out I guess from not knowing some of the new kids -- <BR> Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
461,You really want to do this don't you? <BR> I don't want you to get involved really I mean I do but if something went wrong I mean like you said they may be involved in murder.
462,What were _you_ looking for? <BR> That's none of your business. <BR> You're wrong.
463,I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up. <BR> What are you talking about? <BR> You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him.
464,And where is it now? <BR> In his office.  I saw it this morning.
465,"What? <BR> Did you change cabs?  It didn't work, something moved there--"
466,What are watchin' this junk for? <BR> You can change it if you want to. <BR> I don't know why we have to watch T.V. <BR> Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
467,Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up stick around distract me they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee. <BR> It's makes it easier. Okay. <BR> I don't want to know. <BR> It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why. <BR> That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy.
468,Sorry.  We were saying? <BR> You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry? <BR> Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch take a look around the trophy room and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me.
469,Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit are you Angelo? <BR> Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction. <BR> Thanks for the tip.  I needed this knowledge.
470,Oh well I-if it's inconvenient eh we can't do it now... that's fine too. W-w-w-we'll do it another time. <BR> Hey- <BR> Maybe if you're on the Coast we'll get together and... and we'll meet there.
471,Will you abide by the Council's opinion? <BR> Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
472,What is it with you litterbugs?  Is it a territorial thing marking your turf with your garbage? <BR> You better quit pushing me pal. <BR> I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you 'It's okay just chuck it'? <BR> Look asshole I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem you better take care of it yourself. <BR> Oh no no no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility! <BR> What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out? <BR> I'll do whatever I have to do.
473,Compared to you my friend Shapeley's an amateur.  Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceited <BR> Hey wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you forget it. You're just a headline to me. <BR> A headline? You're not a newspaper man are you?
474,I was wondering whether you'd come at all.. <BR> Don't get up.  And don't act as if I were the queen mother. <BR> I don't expect you to be pleasant. <BR> I don't intend to be. <BR> Can't we sit down? Just for a minute...
475,Hello. <BR> I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide. <BR> Right.
476,Romirez understood.  Not you. <BR> Romirez is dust.
477,...tonight... <BR> You're with him tonight watching the President's Speech when the President... <BR> What if he's busy tonight? <BR> <u>Lure</u> him.  <BR> What are you saying... <BR> Well darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal it's on your conscience believe me he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks folks folks this is a shitty business and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King by the way... <BR> ...on the way in. <BR> When you...  What?  I'm busy. <BR> It's the White House. <BR> <u>Hello</u>.  What?
478,So now uh... you're not... I mean do *you* do the-- <BR> No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure. <BR> Ah well... okay. Good! I just wondered...
479,The battle was won today and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus the eldest God of Rome.  God of my ancestors. <BR> God of passages and changes? <BR> I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius. <BR> You know general there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly it has remained open for three hundred years. <BR> I've read of it. <BR> But have never been? <BR> My only visits to Rome Senator have been through books.  But the war's over time to close the door of war once and for all.
480,Hi... <BR> If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker we want it Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed... <BR> Most of our information comes out of the mouths of babes Mr Lombard - confused and frightened victims. Its all too easily discredited you understand. Now you might be just what weve been waiting for. Your information could be enough to make em sit up and listen.
481,Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say youre my secretary all right? <BR> Your secretary huh! <BR> Id appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you cant dont worry about it. Ill call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but Im in a hurry.  <BR> What are you up to eh Savieer? I mean not this but... Money passports a gun in a microwave? Who are you eh? Who are you?
482,Putz -- that won't be for hours. <BR> I was counting on hours.
483,You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me. <BR> Didn't I? <BR> No I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot.  Was this before Leslie? Before us?...
484,When'd you get to town Raines? <BR> The other day.... <BR> What for? <BR> No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ... <BR> Where you been anyway? <BR> Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ... <BR> You seem a little hinked-up ... <BR> Not at all ...
485,I never see you anymore. Where are you all day? <BR> I go to college. I thought you knew. <BR> Do you want to get some coffee? <BR> I don't drink coffee Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about. <BR> What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?
486,She's too upset. <BR> What about? <BR> Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave. <BR> You mean she just found out? <BR> Yes. <BR> That's not what it looks like Mrs. Mulwray. <BR> What does it look like? <BR> Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell. <BR> You're insane.
487,Looks like two weeks worth of allowance Chief. <BR> I know.  Sorry Dad. <BR> Glad to hear that.
488,Shut up. <BR> Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
489,You've been talking to that venomous fishwife Addison deWitt- <BR> - in this case apparently as trustworthy as the World Almanac! <BR> You knew when you came in that the audition was over that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse... <BR> Not mouse never mouse! If anything - rat! <BR> You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most! <BR> Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to attacked behind my back accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel! <BR> I never said it was! <BR> Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind? Sherwood? Arthur Miller? Beaumont and Fletcher?
490,Paint it out. <BR> Out? <BR> Yeah... Maybe just his arms.  Put some Cerulean Blue there.
491,You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before. <BR> Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor but it can't tell us not to build it! <BR> But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all! <BR> Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction. <BR> I don't understand this Luddite attitude especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act? <BR> There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!
492,Where do you think you're going? <BR> Back in. <BR> You fucking nuts? <BR> Work's over. I'm gonna party. <BR> You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz. <BR> You got that right. <BR> Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car. <BR> Fine.
493,If lawyers for the mob are called controversial why are divorce lawyers called prominent? <BR> Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back. <BR> I just had breakfast with her. She didn't say a word about this.
494,Do you know him? <BR> No but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian. <BR> Caesar is your husband? <BR> Oh no no.  I'm not the marrying kind.
495,What the hell is going on? <BR> Maybe it's an air raid.
496,You don't know how to love. <BR> You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive. <BR> But you knew this was important to me. <BR> What your virginity? Well that's over now.
497,Like me too. <BR> I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another. <BR> No wonder it's such a screwed-up place.
498,You mean that...  I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you. <BR> I'm late. <BR> Air miles you know. I mean you know what that does to my stomach?
499,Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence? <BR> You got some kind of business with him? <BR> I'm looking for him. <BR> Looking for him for what?
500,Are you and Hannah seeing each other James? <BR> No! What gave you that idea? <BR> Relax James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room. <BR> She likes old movies like I do that's all.  Besides she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic. <BR> Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up it's inevitable that it will in some way.
501,Wicked pic in the Penny Saver by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that you know? <BR> You found us in the Penny Saver?
502, <BR> Gonna be fine.  Gonna be fine people?  Are we getting there...?
503,Speedboat in the middle of the ocean... <BR> How soon can we get up and running? <BR> We can't...we got one engine dead and the other limping badly. <BR> I have a schedule...
504,I don't need that Buddy.  I'm not Jack Kennedy. <BR> No you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it? <BR> I do.  I do.  In my own way. <BR> Then what are you scared of honey? <BR> I'm not scared Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps Buddy.  The press the kids the liberals -- they're out there trying to figure out how to tear me down. <BR> They're all your enemies? <BR> Yes! <BR> You personally? <BR> Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that Buddy?  It's not pretty. <BR> Sometimes I think that's what you want. <BR> You've been drinking.  What the hell are you saying?  Jesus you sound like them now! ...  I've gotta keep fighting Buddy for the country.  These people running things the elite ... they're soft chickenshit faggots!  They don't have the long-term vision anymore.  They just want to cover their asses or meet girls or tear each other down.  Oh God this country's in deep trouble Buddy ... and I have to see this through.  Mother would've wanted no less of me ... I'm sorry Buddy.
505,While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin' Nicky just hit him. No matter how big a guy might be Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife he comes back with a gun. And you beat him with a gun you better kill him because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead. <BR> Listen...
506,Hey future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop? <BR> Yeah that's right.
507,A Federal offense. <BR> Get back there! He'll see you!
508,Now you know why youre here Mr Lombard.  It might be difficult for someone like you to discern but we are people of a certain standing. <BR> Appearances can be deceptive Mrs De Moraes. <BR> That depends what youre looking at.
509,"Why are you whispering? <BR> I can't really talk right now. <BR> What did you find? <BR> Evidence of a massive infection. <BR> What kind of infection? <BR> I don't know. <BR> Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too. <BR> Mulder -- <BR> I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by. <BR> I've got a hearing tomorrow -- <BR> -- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away. <BR> Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --"
510,But I'll tell you he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons. <BR> You're still eight pounds over.  What's the reason for this?
511,Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year. <BR> Ben I'm going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She's a negro she weighs three hundred pounds and I've decided to leave my entire estate to her.
512,Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up. <BR> That's okay. I've already had lunch. <BR> You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock. <BR> I mean breakfast. <BR> Yeah sure and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne. <BR> Just one bottle. I believe in moderation. <BR> Look kid it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something go ahead and order it. <BR> Well maybe just one. To be polite. <BR> Cocktail hour is over. The young man would like to order a hamburger.
513,...how do we Explain That?  Hey?  Am I worried...? <BR> ...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching. <BR> <u>Fuck</u> the world.  Try a ten A.M. <u>pitch</u> meeting no sleep coked-to-the-gills and you haven't even read the <u>material</u>. <BR> But how do we explain the fact he was in prison? <BR> How do we explain that?  Ah well you see Wilfred this is where you've never been at a <u>pitch</u>.  You see? His <u>records</u> say he was in prison ... as they must as <u>all</u> the records of Group 303 have the men and the women carried on their roster as belonging somewhere else the <u>secrecy</u> required of....
514,All right let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood? <BR> Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin. <BR> Then vampirism is a genetic defect just like Hemolytic anemia?
515,Is your name Paul Benjamin? <BR> What can I do for you? <BR> I just want to know what your game is mister that's all. <BR> How the hell did you get into the building? <BR> What do you mean how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think? <BR> The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers is that what you do? Is that your game? <BR> I'm looking for my nephew  Thomas. <BR> Thomas? Who's Thomas? <BR> Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me mister. <BR> I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas. <BR> Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew. <BR> You mean Rashid? <BR> Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was? <BR> Well whatever his name is he's not here anymore. He left two days ago and I haven't heard from him since. <BR> And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert or what? <BR> Look lady that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now! <BR> I just want to know where he is. <BR> As far as I know he went back to his parents. <BR> His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents? <BR> That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street. <BR> I always knew that boy had an imagination but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects. <BR> He doesn't go to the Trinity School? <BR> He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn. <BR> And his parents? <BR> His mother's dead and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years. <BR> I shouldn't have let him go. <BR> Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place? <BR> I was about to get run over by a car and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now. <BR> He's in trouble all right. But I don't have any idea what it is. <BR> Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water? <BR> No thank you. <BR> Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected? <BR> Well one thing I suppose but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill. <BR> And you told your nephew about it? <BR> I figured he had a right to know. <BR> And? <BR>  <BR> Those are pretty hostile words.
516,The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf. <BR> Not you my husband?
517,Mulholland Drive. <BR> Mulholland Drive? <BR> That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive. <BR> Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call. <BR> No.... I don't... <BR> We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
518,What is this? <BR> Security. <BR> From what? Jehovah's Witnesses? <BR> There was a break-in. <BR> Downstairs I know. Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six.
519,I understand your impatience but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and... <BR> To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut and we can do whatever the hell we like with her whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear? <BR> But if this trial seems fixed I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want... <BR> We want her burned as a witch! <BR> But in order to do so the church must first prove her heresy or else you'll be burning a martyr... <BR> Well then?  Start proving... or else the church will have another martyr!
520,Plain or roasted?  Alex I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research. <BR> Why?  Aw come on Vicki I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
521,"I was sorry to hear about your wife. <BR> Yes ... I got the money. <BR> The President would like to know if that was the last payment. <BR> I'll bet he would. <BR> Is it? <BR> In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall."
522,See. Money don't buy happiness. I must say she's taking it well. <BR> I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh. <BR> I'd laugh first then I'd kill them. Make sure they heard me laughing.
523,This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is? <BR> Hey it's not your picture on the TV it's mine. So try to be cool. <BR> Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone have I?  I don't think so because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city! <BR> We've got to get out of here. <BR> That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
524,I'm not in trouble. <BR> Yeah you is. I know when people is in trouble and you is.
525,They said she was just rags like somebody - <BR> Stacy did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about? <BR> No way. She had a guy I'da known believe me. Sewing was her life she was really great at it. Poor Freddie. <BR> Did you ever work with her? <BR> Oh sure me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like totally old it was more'n she could handle. <BR> Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her. <BR> She died. She went to Florida to retire like two years ago? She dies own there.
526,And what? These things are octopusses? <BR> I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...
527,Hey that was... intense. <BR> You're still here. <BR> I didn't say I didn't enjoy it. <BR> Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole. <BR> No you're not. <BR> Don't tell me I'm not a fucking asshole when I know I'm a fucking asshole!
528,"What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid? <BR> Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money. <BR> We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out. <BR> ...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it? <BR> No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here -- <BR> It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge. <BR> No, I said to follow 'my' instincts. Now, we go up there and conclude our business. Case closed."
529,Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money. <BR> But I want to. <BR> No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be. <BR> It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new. <BR> Hey let's introduce the brand new you to Hollywood. We haven't seen the roof garden yet.
530,Don't be so modest Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit -- <BR> And as usual no one believed me...
531,Arctic Warrior Arctic Warrior Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Your radio check is affirmative. Over. <BR> Roger that North Island. Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over and out.
532,Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here.  I know what you're trying to do:  kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands.  The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you're a very important individual.  You make me feel good about my investment!  And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't even discuss you.  Both of you have clamped mouths!  But I love all my fighters -- I'll find out about your family.  And about you.  That I promise. <BR> I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse -- <BR> -- to fight?  We'll see...
533,WAIT!!  Where are you? <BR> I'm at the airport.  Why? <BR> Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you. <BR> Well he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
534,Good morning sir. How can I help you? <BR> A coffee and a couple of croissants. <BR> Crow what? <BR> Croissants. <BR> Im sorry sir. Could you try that again? <BR> Croissants. Like that...
535,Still foolishly perhaps I had a theory that eliminates the Presidential push-button.  I was doing my homework... <BR> On radio waves? <BR> And garbage doors.
536,Right!  An early start with Janet's debut on 'Good Morning Denton.' By the time we unveil Farley's 'Faith Factory' we will have earned our beauty sleep. <BR> Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home? <BR> Home?
537,Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life Highlander.  It's going to be a long one. <BR> That is what bothers me. <BR> I see.  You don't care about life anymore.
538,Bad time? <BR> Kind of. <BR> Well you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldn't have invited me in.

541,Hey Ziat hurry up with the tea will ay! <BR> Work work work that's all do <BR> I don't hear you bitch about the money.
542,You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating? <BR> I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.
543,Were you going somewhere tonight Jeff? <BR> Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year. <BR> I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here Jeff. <BR> Did I do something wrong Mr. Hand?
544,Safe and sound thanks to you. What the fuck was that? <BR> The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire? <BR> No but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast. <BR> Two?  Are you sure?
545,Republican? <BR> Sure. <BR> Who'd you vote for? <BR> When? <BR> '68. <BR> Nixon.
546,Could be a shark.  But maybe not. <BR> Look I know a little bit about sharks. <BR> Do you? <BR> I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
547,All right all right he's been snorting that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days. <BR> What's his name? <BR> IB Bangin. <BR> What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
548,Talking to me dad? <BR> Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off! <BR> Well then forget all this stern dad stuff. <BR> I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home.
549,You can't run away from the planet Miss Science. You can't even run away from the island heh heh. <BR> Leave me alone you...COCKSUCKER!!!
550,Jesus. We've been at this for six months. <BR> I know. <BR> And you haven't made an ounce of progress. <BR> I know.
551,Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard. <BR> Yeah I was phoning your mother. <BR> You old devil. Well anyway as you can see we're leaving. <BR> So I gathered. <BR> Yeah I'm sorry but that's the way it is. <BR> It's all right. I'll forward your mail. <BR> No really I am sorry sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally. <BR> Oh no no no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best. <BR> For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer. <BR> Not at all. <BR> I mean we've had ups and downs right -- good times bad times? <BR> Yeah? <BR> But more laughter than tears I think? Yes. On balance? I mean remember that time when -- oh we could talk all night but we have to go. Don't we Juliet?
552,"What day is this? <BR> Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think. <BR> Think the tide's with us? <BR> Just keep kicking. <BR> Y'know, I used to hate the water... <BR> I can't imagine why."

556,I'm going to the dance. <BR> What for? <BR> In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende? <BR> I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer? <BR> It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand. <BR> You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires. <BR> I don't want to kill anybody and I don't want to talk about it anymore. <BR> Listen I know you're bummed about your friend and I'm really sorry... <BR> He did what he was supposed to. <BR> But Buffy you're the guy the chosen guy. <BR> Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping. <BR> I should have known.
557,... Many men have tried. <BR> Did they try and fail? <BR> They tried and died.
558,You expecting somebody you know? <BR> Well you don't have to get snippy with me. <BR> Sorry.
559,He got better. <BR> I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone.  Better huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.
560,What other girl? <BR> The little O'Brien girl of course - the one you suggested in the story. <BR> But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that. <BR> Gallagher what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play? <BR> No. <BR> There's nothing sudden about that  He's always loved the girl but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl and - here I'll show you.
561,That's right I know.  I fucking know. <BR> Know what? <BR> Open the case! <BR> All right!  Where's the key? <BR> You don't need a key.

563,Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ? <BR> I know. Weird huh -- ?
564,"Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one. <BR> You're leaving? <BR> Going out on the 'Aurora.' <BR> Is that a boat? <BR> Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months. <BR> Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them. <BR> Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding... <BR> I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat? <BR> Yep. <BR> Martin hates boats. Hates the water. On the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over. He's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it."
565,This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine. <BR> Good to meet you.
566,So...what happened to you Jimmy?  I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere living on the edge like the good old days. <BR> I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change I guess.
567,All right let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying. <BR> You think I'm lying? <BR> I didn't say that but since you did let's say that you are.  It would have been easy to set Shelly up.  You could have got him killed knowing that Caesar would bring the money to the apartment.
568,The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe. <BR> Dewey there's no such place. <BR> Humor me Sid.
569,Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby? <BR> Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
570,It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him. <BR> So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg. <BR> What are you giving me with the omelette? <BR> Nag nag nag.  Look we got a yacht we got a bracelet you got Osgood I've got Sugar - we're really cooking. <BR> Joe - <BR> What?

573,Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago. <BR> He's trying to make it. <BR> He'll think something's wrong I ain't there. <BR> He'll know you were smart enough to stay away Boss. <BR> What the fuck does that mean? <BR> You know that if you come we gotta invite Maranzano. <BR> So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come. <BR> So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
574,"This man's still alive. <BR> Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover."
575,Who's this fuck? <BR> He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking. <BR> From the neighborhood?  Shut the fuck up.  You like telephones? Huh?. You wanta go for a ride?
576,Pop the trunk Tumbler. <BR> What for -- ? <BR> I gotta get my tool --

578,We don't even have a dog! <BR> Yeah because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners. <BR> Wow dream big! <BR> Oh go fly a kite.
579,And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it? <BR> I was grateful.
580,*What* view? <BR> Well Muddy we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
581,Yeah Sophie. <BR> A Miss Sessions calling. <BR> Who? <BR> Ida Sessions. <BR> Don't know her. Take a number.
582,Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them and they in turn could present it to their various peoples. <BR> That's what I came to see you about.
583,That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning? <BR> You figured that out huh?
584,Guys let's not panic.  Isabella's safe. <BR> How do you know? <BR> You said she was going to drive into a lake.  How can she when she's in protective custody?
585,Then say so. <BR> Yes Addison. <BR> And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me? <BR> Yes Addison. <BR> Take your nap now. And good luck for tonight.
586,LeSeure. But I went to high school in White Bear Lake. <BR> Okay I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like.
587,Sam let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife. <BR> Yeah sure I do. Why? <BR> No tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth so many of my clients don't. <BR> Well...
588,Hey what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir. <BR> If you don't get out of here I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours. <BR> SorryI didn't mean to <BR> Get out! <BR> Okay. I was just trying to make conversation.
589,What're you doing? <BR> I'm looking for a phone... <BR> No I don't think you can <u>do</u> that. <BR> Watch me. <BR> No I don't think you can <u>do</u> that Stanley... <BR> Watch me. <BR> Stanley.  Stanley... you knew the... Stanley.  You knew the deal when you signed <u>on</u>. <BR> Deal's changed. <BR> No the deal <u>isn't</u> changed.  The Deal <u>isn't</u> changed. You can't ... what is it?  Money?  <u>Money</u>?  You want Money? <BR> <u>Money</u>?  You think I did this for money...?  I did this for <u>Credit</u>.  <u>Credit</u> paalll... <BR> But you always knew you couldn't <u>take</u> the credit.... <BR> That's <u>one</u> thing but I'm not gonna let two dickheads from <u>Filmschool</u> take it... are you <u>Nuts</u>?  Are you <u>Nuts</u>?
590,Jesus last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean the city can't close down. You know what-whatta yuh gonna do h-have 'em shut down the airport too? No more flights so we can have sex? <BR> I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York. <BR> Well I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner and... uh there's the screens with the dead moths behind them and... uh yuh got the-the Manson family possibly yuh got Dick and Terry- <BR> Okay okay my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
591,I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony? <BR> After we've completed our investigation.
592,You know what you pulled back there that was bullshit. <BR> I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police Sam and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops... <BR> Well I ain't a cop.
593,No... <BR> Look Jimmy you know I haven't seen you in eight years you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!
594,I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you but all I get is the busy signal.  I figure the phone is off the hook that's why I come rushing over here. <BR> Oh Christ the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do wasn't it? <BR> Hey if Violet was helping me relax I'd probably do the same thing.
595,"Can I tell you a story, Rick? <BR> Has it got a wow finish? <BR> I don't know the finish yet. <BR> Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along. <BR> It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love. <BR> "
596,But as long as there have been vampire there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies the next is called. <BR> I'm just a girl. <BR> You are much more.
597,Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back! <BR> Holly -- that's not so.
598,I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy. <BR> How senior? <BR> You asking me to disclose my source?
599,This is the millennium Saddam! This is Armageddon! There's more to life than sex! <BR> Hey relax guy! <BR> Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND. <BR> I DO respect your mind! It turns me on! It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of you! Don't you see?
600,Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do. <BR> Nothing. <BR> Isn't that like waiting and seeing? <BR> No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him too. <BR> I know.  Is *that* nothing. <BR> No don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
601,Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love? <BR> You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me Harry why should I be smiling? <BR> As usual that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots these were special idiots seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie forty rolls of film cameras lock picks pen-sized tear gas guns plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills. <BR> Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse? <BR> Two o'clock work the phones 'til you go.
602,I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you. <BR> What? <BR> This is a considerable move up for you Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you. <BR> You don't trust me? <BR> I don't trust anyone. You don't get to the top of this game by trusting people... and after all you are a thief. It's in your nature to steal. I'm just protecting my investment.
603,...has a prior commitment. <BR> What's mezzaluna? <BR> A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona. <BR> That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you thank you thank you.
604,I love you baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours? <BR> Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein you love money so much.
605,And Dick beat the shit out of them. <BR> But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you. <BR> Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that. <BR> When they know you've got something to protect that's when they fuck you!
606, <BR> You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ... <BR> Of course we've tried but so far we've come up with nothing that ... <BR> Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson the New York Times the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them. <BR> I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area Mr. President given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ... <BR> Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well going back to the '50's this agency reports what it wants and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this.
607,Your home address. Oh just the town will do. <BR> Los Angeles.
608,Where's he going? <BR> I don't know... but I think he's pissed. <BR> Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose. <BR> Krueger's the greater danger right now. We have to stop him.  _Springwood_. That's where he'll go. That's where he's always gone.
609,Very well.  If you tell me not to worry I shan't. <BR> Sam...  Thank you.
610,May I...? <BR> May I ask if you are Jewish Mr Lombard?
611,"Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox? <BR> Yeah. That was me. <BR> Why? <BR> Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint. <BR> Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front. <BR> You know I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you. <BR> You know it's okay. <BR> Also I think I'm in love with you. <BR> What you mean as friends? <BR> No for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try. <BR> I try really hard actually... <BR> No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, Junebug MacGuff Row 4 Third Seat From the Blackboard""""? And it said """"I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here""""? That was hilarious."" <BR> I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time. <BR> Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard. <BR> It does?"
612,You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that? <BR> Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours.
613,You know where they are? <BR> Sure. <BR> How far? <BR> About ten kilometers. <BR> Sixty Lira? <BR> Sixty?
614,Oh you know Bosnia the importance of the right to vote... <BR> Yeah we talked about sex too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep. <BR> We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much... <BR> Yes you do. <BR> Yeah. I guess I do. <BR> Talia's a rock. She'll be fine...
615,How many of these you gonna eat huh? <BR> Two. <BR> Two?
616,Well do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea? <BR> How do you know about Dr. Becker? <BR> My dad wrote some things down before he died.
617,Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex. <BR> What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida we'll blow this set-up. <BR> This time I'm not going to let you talk me into something that...
618,Don't do anything stupid Cotton. You've come to far. <BR> Gale I don't know what I'm doing from one moment to the next. I'm just taking it as it comes.
619,Oh impressive wingspan.  Very good! <BR> Oh what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
620,Are you from Washington originally? <BR> Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married. <BR> Oh. When did you move back? <BR> After the divorce. <BR> Oh. <BR> How long you been married? <BR> Uh... uh...  Umm... long time. <BR> You don't look like a native if you don't mind my saying so. <BR> No I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy. <BR> Well from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy? <BR> Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari. <BR> Oh yeah Bari. I've been there. <BR> No really? <BR> Oh yeah. Actually I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
621,Ach! Here you are Doctor Zinnowitz. <BR> Have I kept you waiting? <BR> Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester. <BR> No news yet? <BR> No. No word. <BR> Everything depends on the Manchester merger. <BR> I know -- I know. <BR> I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
622,Yeah? <BR> Have you pulled yourself together? <BR> ...Not yet.
623,"They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do. <BR> Half. <BR> What? <BR> They paid us half. They still owe us half... <BR> "
624,Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope. <BR> Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears.  Not like now.
625, <BR>  <BR> Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it.  Look houses in which we don't live.

627,What's your point? <BR> You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.

What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this? <BR> I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie I'm trying to make good here. <BR> Okay.    Okay. <BR> I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
631,You want me to wait? <BR> No. Mr. Green I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.
632,Please don't get a divorce! God Mark just do me a solid and stay with your wife. <BR> God you're so young. <BR> Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old enough to tell when people are acting like total a-holes!
633,Don't even think about it. <BR> Why not? <BR>  <BR> If there was one. <BR>  <BR> Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
634,Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy? <BR> The Cowboy?? <BR> Yeah the Cowboy. This guy the Cowboy wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea. <BR> Oh Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters? <BR> Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening Adam and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away. <BR> Cynthia...what's going on? <BR> It's been a very strange day. <BR> And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range? <BR> Sort of funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be. <BR> You gotta be kidding? <BR> Will you meet with him? <BR> Yeah sure. It is that kind of a day. When? <BR> I'll call him then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.
635,So... <BR> So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
636,"You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam? <BR> I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas. <BR> Got a warrant? <BR> You fit a lot of descriptions. <BR> I figger a man's only good for one oath at a time...I took mine to the Confederate States of America...  So did you, Reverend..."
637,If you ask me she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying? <BR> No Damone. I don't understand. <BR> She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway. <BR> Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove? <BR> Jesus. I'm sorry. <BR> I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well you know Damone maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out. <BR> Fine. Get lost.
638,Joe you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make. <BR> Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!

640,I gotta take a squirt where's the commode in this dungeon? <BR> Go down the hall turn left up those stairs then turn right.
641,Okay okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up. <BR> My mom? Don't call my mom. <BR> Why not? ... Oh wow she doesn't know you're here. In fact you're grounded. Jesus you could get in a shitload of trouble for this. I think I should call her anyway.
642,Look... what I'm doing is none of your business... <BR>  <BR> Friend... why don't you back off.
643,You're going to have to walk back to the border. <BR> Don't worry about me I'll grab a cab... I can afford it you know.

645,And then I saw her.  And all I know is when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on something I'd never seen before-- <BR> Mania. <BR> Whatever.  And I thought please God give me a sign give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever.  And He did. She told me the name.  Granted it wasn't my name but it was a start.
646,My parents? What do you mean? <BR> I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty. <BR> You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot. <BR> Well kid I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
647,Adorable. We now got everything a dressing room needs except a basketball hoop. <BR> Just because you can't even work a zipper. It was very thoughtful Eve and I appreciate it-
648,Terrance and Phillip you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU! <BR> Dude what the hell is going on?
649,It's 1942 right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place and there's Bakhtin holed up in an apartment expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes. <BR> His only copy? <BR> His only copy.  I mean if you think you're going to die what's more important a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed and little by little he smoked his book. <BR> Nice try. You had me going for a second but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he? <BR> You don't believe me huh?  Look I'll show you. It's all in this book.
650,You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality especially for a mathematician! <BR> Chaotician actually!  Chaotician!
651,I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier Rick in a way that made me extremely jealous. <BR> I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see the last time we met --
652,Ain't no Council Fire Brother. Clear Moon... <BR> I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead. <BR> Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die. <BR> Bullshit let's get outta here
653,D'you ask the patient when did she last eat? <BR> Yes. <BR> What did she say? <BR> She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital. <BR> One hour. <BR> Yes. <BR> And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record standing for one hour? <BR> I did. <BR> A single hour. <BR> Yes.
654,What does it say? <BR> John N. Mitchell while serving as US Attorney General personally controlled a secret cash fund that-- <BR> --jeeeeeeesus-- <BR> --fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats-- <BR> --jeeeeeeesus-- <BR> --according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971-- <BR> --jeeeeeeesus-- <BR> --almost a year before he left the Justice Department-- <BR> --jeeeeeeeeesus-- <BR> --to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1 Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund-- <BR> --all that crap you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard. <BR> Sir I'd like to ask you a few-- <BR> --what time is it? <BR> 11:30. <BR> Morning or night? <BR> Night. <BR> Oh.
655,Oh Tom that was awful. <BR> I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter.  I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all what do you know about him?
656,You son-of-a-bitch... <BR> What? <BR> You speak French. <BR> What of it? <BR> Nothing...
657,You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place? <BR> You didn't ask. <BR> Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say? <BR> Stay put. Okay fellas take a look at the little surprise I brought you.
658,You mean because his career's ruined and all? <BR> Jesus. Is that what he told you? <BR> He said he hasn't had a success in ten years and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of a...
659, <BR> I'm afraid we have another problem Mr. President.
660,Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait. <BR> There's a charming thought.
661,They don't serve wine here. <BR> What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine? <BR> This kind. <BR> Okay.    I will have a beer.
662,Do we need anything else? <BR> Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
663,"Often enough to keep the franchise. <BR> A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.  I mean it, now. Grown-up women only, I might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight...  Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?"
664,Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby... <BR> Hey I like this. <BR> This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave. <BR> You don't have to do that. <BR> It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was? <BR> I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges Patti Smith and the Runaways. <BR> Yeah I definitely need to make you some CDs. At least while my kid is hanging out in there.
665,This is an official matter Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going? <BR> To find out who killed my husband. <BR> The doors and walls are monitored Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment. <BR> So am I.
666,Ah... <BR> I have a suggestion.  There's really not much time left - I mean you haven't had a minute alone yet and - well I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket... if you'd like. <BR> I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind? <BR> Of course not.
667,Ma you sick? <BR> Ya say we're acrost? <BR> Look Ma! <BR> Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us.  <BR> Didn' you get no sleep? <BR> No. <BR> Was Granma bad? <BR> Granma's dead. <BR> When? <BR> Since before they stopped us las' night. <BR> An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look? <BR> I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross.

676,"It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision. <BR> What are you thinking? Are you angry with me? <BR> Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you. <BR> That's astonishing. Sera, look... <BR> I hate to think of you in that cheesy motel. I mean..."
677,No Richard no. What has happened to you? Last night we said -- <BR> -- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong. <BR> But Richard no I I -- <BR> -- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true Louis?
678,Hear you had a little trouble Quintero. Defective fuse?  Well you're all in one piece. So what's the beef? <BR> You know the beef. This new rule of yours that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super. <BR> Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee. <BR> So much the better.
679,Don't laugh. -- I could do it! <BR> That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard?  <BR> I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit. <BR> Let's not talk any more nonsense huh?
680,"Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona. <BR> She said she was in Arizona, did she?"
681,Can't we talk about this alone Mr. Gittes? <BR> I'm afraid not Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself. <BR> Of course not. <BR> Now what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
682,I heard you Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall. <BR> Those sounds could be imitated. <BR> I'd know the difference.
683,Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask. <BR> I appreciate your concern but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
684,Sorry to keep you waiting. <BR>  <BR> It's all down to this...
685,Yeah the neighborhood's gonna be great. <BR> We can show her the schoolyard. <BR> Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her Max I was the best I was all schoolyard. <BR> Yes I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once he tried to dribble it. <BR> Yeah well I used to lose my glasses a lot.
686,He's going to kill you Aramis. <BR> Then let him kill me if all my faith is wrong.
687,"... That's what you told us to say. <BR> Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?"
688,Did you see that shit? Motherfucker.  You let in fucking Screech dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech? <BR> He's on the list. <BR> Show me. Show me where it says Screech on the fucking list.
689,What do you think you're doing? <BR> Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
690,Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you. <BR> This cannot be.
691,Well of course they're me!  That's how God talks to me.  If you listen hard enough even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him. <BR> But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy kill your enemy -- what is good what is evil...? <BR> All you have to do is stop talking and just listen. <BR> But how do you know what you hear is the truth? <BR> I don't know it.  I feel it. <BR> You make it sound so simple... <BR> The truth is always simple... it's you Jean who's making things complicated. <BR> Me?!  It's not me it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why why?! <BR> So... even you don't believe in me anymore... <BR> Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
692,The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place? <BR> And the concrete moats and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald dear boy do try to relax and enjoy yourself. <BR> Let's get something straight John.  This is not a weekend excursion this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors whom I represent are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John. <BR> Forty-eight hours from now I'll be accepting your apologies.  Now get out of the way.  So I can see them!
693,He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here. <BR> What did he want? <BR> He asked how you are. <BR> And you said? <BR> I said you are fine he should leave you the hell alone. <BR> I'm a forensic specialist Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything. <BR> You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that... <BR> We have it good don't we? <BR> All the things that happened to you before make you know that...
694,"Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet. <BR> Oww! My arm, careful! <BR> Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again? <BR> No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out. <BR> Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there! <BR> I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was... <BR> ...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here! <BR> No, Elden, I need to... <BR> You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's... <BR> She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman. <BR> It wasn't a woman. <BR> Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe... <BR> I'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, Roy!"
695,Come on man -- Vietnam ain't Germany. It doesn't threaten us.  It's a civil war between the Vietnamese. <BR> But change always comes slowly.  I've withdrawn more than half the troops. I'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years.  I want an all-volunteer army.  But it's also a question of American credibility our position in the world ...
696,No way! She's pretty. <BR> You sound shocked or something. <BR> I just thought she'd look really old in real life.
697,I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you. <BR> Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here. <BR> You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and   <BR> I know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail.
698,Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit the last thing we need is a coronary. <BR> You're the Doctor sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked then. <BR> Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady. <BR> And what's Steven's status? <BR> Still alive but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection -- <BR>  <BR>  <BR> -- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger -- <BR>  <BR> So what stopped her? <BR> It's complicated. But don't worry -- <BR> -- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr? <BR> Not yet. <BR> So we don't even know if she's alive or dead -- <BR> -- Price killed her there's no other explanation -- <BR> -- there's plenty: for all we know Steven's got her spying on us right now -- <BR> -- bullshit -- <BR> -- the whole thing is falling apart!
699,Where's your brother? <BR> I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink? <BR> No. That's okay. <BR> Well I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind. <BR> Naw. I don't mind.
700,We can't stay in here! <BR>  <BR> This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack! <BR> It'll hold! <BR> For sixty seconds maybe!  Look at this!  You could-
701,All this time... I was a lost secret.  But you were hiding all your loyalty all your love.  You were the Man in the Iron Mask. <BR> D'Artagnan...
702,You didn't actually purchase this car did you. Trip?? <BR> It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money. <BR> He owes God money. You know he queered himself for good with Esquire.
703,What's the word on the chairs? <BR> I'm working on it. <BR> Then you'd better work on it in the car. We gotta go see the Judge.
704,What are we doing here? <BR> Living.  Remember? <BR> You may be living -- but this suit is killing me.
705,"Yes, you always had a good sense of timing, Henry.  When to give and when to take. How do you think Mao, Brezhnev will react?  Do you think this is how they'll remember me, Henry, after all the great things you and I did together? As some kind of ... of ... crooks? <BR> They will understand, sir.  To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions.  History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries. <BR> That depends who writes the history books.  I'm not a quitter ... but I'm not stupid either ... A trial would kill me -- that's what they want.  But they won't get it."
706,I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down. <BR> Easy Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass watch the trees watch the shit house be on your toes and if we get committed don't hesitate to empty that sucker. <BR> Alright. Alright.
707,Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is... <BR> ...closed?
708,We need guns. <BR> We don't need guns. <BR> I think we might. <BR> He didn't say we need guns. <BR> He implied it. <BR> You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides I'm not taking the job.
709,Come on come on you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name. <BR> What difference does it make?
710,Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on okay? <BR> It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if you know ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later she's in our living room. <BR> She answered our prayers. <BR> Ever since it's just been like a ticking clock.
711,What do you take me for? <BR> I don't know what I take you for anything... <BR> It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them? <BR> I'm sure you mean something by that Addison but I don't know what... <BR> Look closely Eve it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm nobody's fool. Least of all - yours. <BR> I never intended you to be. <BR> Yes you did. You still do.
712,Can I come with her? <BR> No Hallie I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
713,What'd you get on W.House? <BR> Lotsa hints-- <BR> I can't sell hints to Simons--  --you called everyone you know?  Call someone you don't know.
714,What was I thinking right? <BR> I can't protect you anymore. <BR> What about you? <BR> I'm gonna find the end of this.  I can't protect you.
715,Ever heard of the Mary Celeste? <BR> Nope. <BR> She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding they found her completely deserted. The captain his wife their daughter and the entire crew all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard. <BR> So what did happen? <BR> Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories of course. But we'll never really know for sure. <BR> You think she's sailing without a crew?
716,So your argument is that title dictates behavior? <BR> What? <BR> The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description and I'm supposed to follow it right? <BR> Exactly.
717,It's like Charley Vidal says -- there's two kinds of slavery wage slavery and domestic slavery. The Woman Question he calls it. <BR> The woman question? <BR> Question question -- the problem what to do about 'em. <BR> So? What does he want to do about 'em? <BR> He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs equality in the home. Also sex equality. <BR> What do you mean -- sex equality? <BR> You know ...  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
718,Ed all I'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is when you're working on a piece of research - <BR> Walter I sympathize but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy -- <BR> That MCP you know that's half the problem right -- <BR> The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that -- <BR> User requests are what computers are for. <BR> Doing our business is what computers are for. Look Walter with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --
719,You okay? <BR> Yeah. You? <BR> Yes. Well I guess we can walk from here.
720,We're wasting time. <BR> See!  That's what I like about you man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade.
721,Jeez it all looks like bad late-night cable. <BR> Sad commentary huh?
722,I've been so lonely. <BR> I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am. <BR> Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous. <BR> Don't take another step.
723,What colour is your car?  What colour is your car? <BR> B-Black... <BR> Where is it? <BR> Downstairs... At the front... Jesus...
724,I'm on the move - <BR> Your girl works in there ... <BR> Not my girl anymore <BR> Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours 24 hours ago ... <BR> What do you want from me? <BR> Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...
725,Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill? <BR> Yeah refill'd be great.
726,--Jesus-- <BR> --he said John Haldeman not Bob Haldeman--
727,You see my dear the word has gone around. <BR> As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You however are a different matter. <BR> Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.
728,I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini. <BR> Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
729,Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill? <BR> I didn't know sir. <BR> It's your job to know.  If something goes wrong up there the other eighteen people aboard can't be wondering if he's gonna do his job or not.
730,Maybe she didn't come here. <BR> She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime I need you to shimmy through.
731,To the mine? <BR> Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.
732,Let's check out the penguins. <BR> The what? <BR> The penguin house. <BR> Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now? <BR> Yeah. Let's look at the penguins. <BR> Did you hear what he just said? <BR> Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house. <BR> I'm tired and I'm scared and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
733,Say ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy? <BR> Yeah. On my way home now. <BR> Well I do declare!  I baptized you son. <BR> Why you're the preacher! <BR> *Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit. <BR> Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher. <BR> I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things. <BR> Maybe you should a got yourself a wife. <BR> At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad an' pray an' pray but it didn't do no good. Next time do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me. <BR> I never let one go by me when I could catch her. <BR> But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say. <BR> Have a little snort? <BR> Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor. <BR> Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck. <BR> Been out travelin' around? <BR> Didn't you hear? It was in the papers. <BR> No I never. What? <BR> I been in the penitentiary for four years.  <BR> Excuse me for asking. <BR> I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash. <BR> And you ain't ashamed? <BR> He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole. <BR> Ain't you seen your folks since then? <BR> No but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it too. Which way you going? <BR> It don't matter. Ever since I lost the sperit it looks like I just as soon go one way as the other.  I'll go your way.
734,Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasnt here but he got to my husband sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over Ł1000 to get rid of him. <BR> And that is the last time any... <BR> Well Leon does not need money for prints Mr Lombard. Does his own printing. Wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his Art!  Which as he subsequently vanished raises the question: what was the money for? Perish the thought.

748,He's dead Rose. Your father passed. <BR> How can that be? He was getting better. <BR> He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry. <BR> He was tough. You did all you could. <BR> I'm sorry. <BR> You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
749,I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night. <BR> It doesn't matter.
750,I'm gonna lose you Charlie. <BR> It'll all be over tomorrow. No more wars. No more killin'. Just livin' normal like everybody else.  You'll be stuck with me for good.

But I went to the clinic last week with Jennie.
757,So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him or what? <BR> Sometimes. <BR> Sometimes which? <BR> Sometimes neither. <BR> Some... What does that mean? <BR> There's nothing wrong in liking sex John. <BR> I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again. <BR> Why? <BR> Well it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman or alone for that matter makes me want to die. <BR> So now you hate all women? <BR> I think it's my safest bet don't you? <BR> Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.

763,That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost -- <BR> What about it? <BR> He had it hidden in the dresser! Well at least it was in there. He took it out went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone. <BR> Someone not his wife? <BR> I never saw him ask her for advise before.  But she volunteered plenty.

I want some answers Nash. <BR> I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it. <BR> That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were. <BR> It's late.
772,Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over! <BR> I might call to check up on her you know... to see if she's better? <BR> She's fine really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip. <BR> I know. I was there when she arrived.
773,Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him. <BR> Oh yeah? <BR> Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken. <BR> Jeffrey!! <BR> Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place. <BR> I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Jeffrey?. Why? <BR> I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret. <BR> You like mysteries that much? <BR> Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you. very much.
774,There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day.  I can't even tell you some of the things I thought about. <BR> I used to have those feelings too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away. <BR> I don't know what I'd do if I lost you.
775,I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some. <BR> There's no sin in charity Jeanne. <BR> They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small. <BR> Whose were they? <BR> My father's. <BR> I'm sure he'll forgive you. <BR> He already did but I want God to forgive me too. <BR> Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time we'd spend our whole life in church. <BR> Is that bad? <BR> Well no but... Jeanne are you happy at home? <BR> Oh yes... very. <BR> And your mother -- everything's fine with her? <BR> Oh yes she's... wonderful.
776,I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain? <BR> I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen. <BR> Ricky I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I. <BR> Oh thanks. <BR> Go ahead Ricky.
777,Oh but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel. <BR> The Grand Hotel. <BR> Oh but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life -- <BR> Life! -- Mr. Kringelein you are drunk -- good night.  <BR> But Doctor --
778,Was it the break-in? <BR> Excuse me? <BR> We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke. <BR> I hadn't heard.
779,It's my own design. You won't find another table like it in the world. <BR> It was a beautiful present. <BR> Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?! <BR> You need a table. <BR> She was going to throw it out wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood. <BR> It wasn't like that. <BR> Then what? What?! <BR> She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it. <BR> I made that table for you and Annette for your wedding. I put a lot of love into it. <BR> I know man. I love this table too.  But I also love my wife.
780,Hey Buffy... <BR> Yeah? <BR> You know you saved my life.  And I just wanted to say... I forgive you for talking during the movie. Almost.
781,So things change.  The government has moved to the circus.  You're going to fight last.  And Commodus is going to fight first. <BR> You were a soldier and then a gladiator weren't you? <BR> Was I?
782,Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise. <BR> Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again Mrs. Peel --
783,Whu -- <BR> There's no touching. <BR> But what about them? <BR> I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.
784,Mr. Zammito? <BR> Uh huh. <BR> I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother. <BR> I don't know what you're talking about. <BR> I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you. <BR> How? <BR> You see that car?
785,You okay? <BR> Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean what's the big deal?
786,Perceval you have returned! <BR> Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now at last I will rule.
787,-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? -- <BR> Nykwana Wombosi.  <BR> What is that? <BR> It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane.  <BR> What does that mean?  Jason what does that mean?  Jason please...who is he? <BR> I don't know.  <BR> <u>So what are we doing</u>? <BR> Go back to the hotel.
788,After we ate we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it. <BR> What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that? <BR> No of course not. <BR> You mean I have your permission? <BR> Sure you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here. <BR> I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home. <BR> Nick I gotta tell you I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit. <BR> Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
789,He's recovering on the third floor. <BR> Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic! <BR> Then how would you describe him Beth? Merely rebellious?
790,What happened? <BR> Jesus Christ Pop let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
791,Why? <BR> I'm not asking you to marry me. <BR> No. What? No. I know. <BR> It's more like a date. <BR> It's a long way to go for a date. <BR> Tell me about it.
792,We haven't said grace yet.  Richard. <BR> Is it my turn?
793,--listen we didn't make them do these things--once they did it's our job to report it-- <BR> --go over your sources again--
794,Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening? <BR> 
795,I came to feed your fish. I didnt know... <BR> Oui bonjour Jean... Oui trčs bien merci. Dites-moi pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandémes services ŕquelquun récemment... Vous ętes certain... Non non...  Je vous remercie...  <BR> Hello there. Hows the flat. I cleaned... <BR> Jane there was an envelope in my desk. The one Id given you and then got back remember? I cant find it. Do you know where it is? <BR> No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe its there with... <BR> Its not. <BR> Well Im sorry. I...  This is my nephew... And my brother Tim. Ive got the week off and hes come to stay.
796,She didn't know anything about...I wouldn't have wanted her to. <BR> Lucky girl.
797,Dude how can you hate the environment? <BR> 'Cuz dude it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
798,Okay so we got a state trooper pulls someone over we got a shooting and these folks drive by and we got a high-speed pursuit ends here and this execution-type deal. <BR> Yah. <BR> I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd. <BR> Yah.
799,What did you see?  What am I looking for? <BR> No it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
800,Me? Why me? <BR> Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
801,So... why can't Jason get a fair trial? <BR> Because everyone knows he's guilty... <BR> Wrong. Jason can't get a fair trial because of _these_.
802,Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water.  As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with our water. <BR> Then I will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.
803,Shit. No new pages. I don't even know where the fuck we're supposed to go. <BR> Maybe we should call for a cab. <BR> No. Look. There.
804,"Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me? <BR> Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much."
805,He told you. <BR> He told me. <BR> And what did you say? <BR> I said it didn't sound like you.
806,Stop it!  What are you doing? <BR> Nothing... just taking his teeth. <BR> But you can't just kill a man for his teeth! <BR> Why not?  He has good teeth... <BR> Because... because you just can't!
807,I'm still on anti-biotics I really                         ] shouldn't be caffeining...Gosh I've had a lot of daydreams about losing my virginity. Never one like this. For one I wasn't a mutant. Secondly I...What are you thinking? <BR> I'm just thinking I'm glad I broke up with everyone I ever went out with.  The swelling is gonna go down right?
808,Don't worry Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by. <BR> All right! Oh yeah!
809,You're not helping. <BR> Julien what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
810,You... <BR> Hi there... <BR> Before you start picking your nose I know he put you up to it.
811,I was upstairs with Eddie -- <BR> -- that's the fact bud -- <BR> -- where the hell were you?
812,Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two.  Switch to another station huh? You're driving me crazy with that. <BR> 
813,The pain. The fucking pain! <BR> And you feel like you're being ripped open inside. <BR> You are being ripped open. <BR> I know. <BR> Did you bleed? <BR> I didn't bleed. <BR> You didn't? <BR> No I didn't bleed.
814,I was driven out. <BR> And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew. <BR> How can you know this? <BR> First food no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
815,Excuse me but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her? <BR> Just briefly. What's the problem Officer?
816,"When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it?  That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there. <BR> It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters. <BR> Point taken."
817,That really sucked Eric what you did asking him that... <BR> Oh thanks it was nothing... <BR> You know I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it... <BR> Sure Wichita. Whatever you say...
818,"What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing? <BR> Anger, social resentment, sexual frus- <BR> No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer. <BR> No. We just - <BR> No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want? <BR> All right, then tell me how - <BR> No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch? <BR> Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll - <BR> We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have. <BR> Later, listen, I'll - <BR> I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ? <BR> And - one morning I just - ran away..."
819,You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin? <BR> What's that? <BR> A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real you see it everywhere -- in weather in river flooding in baseball in blackjack in stock markets.  Once things go bad they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together. <BR> Feeling a bit blue are we?
820,Look I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really. <BR> It's okay. I didn't think you were.
821,Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby. <BR> Real 'quality-timers' Hugh. <BR> Something like that. <BR> Hey it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house all helpless and vulnerable...
822,I'm sorry I can't. <BR> Listen dammit. <BR> I just can't.
823,Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for? <BR> Don't know. <BR> Jesus... I Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them... <BR> I'm sorry Ward.
824,"He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull. <BR> Why don't we just tow it in? <BR> We will. There's something I've got to find out. <BR> Be careful, for chrissake."
825,He's very careful very... designed when he chooses.  If we find out how he finds them then we'll find him. <BR> There's no connection between the families. <BR> There has to be. <BR> There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.
826,The shadows suit us Frost. We've existed this way for thousands of years. Who are you to challenge our ways? <BR> Someone who's sick of living off scraps. The coming age belongs to us not the humans!  When the final war between our races comes who do you want leading the charge?
827,Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing? <BR> James is... I don't know... <BR> Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him he's going to be even more disturbed. <BR> I'm not sure that's possible. <BR> Sure it is.
828,What is it? <BR> This is the hotel supervisor Mr Lamont. Im terribly sorry to disturb you but theres been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve. <BR> What are you talking about? <BR> We need a double-room and as I understand youre here alone wed be much obliged if youd agree to move to a single room...
829,Maybe but we shore takin' a beatin'. <BR> I know. Maybe that makes us tough. Rich fellas come up an' they die an' their kids ain't no good an' they die out. But we keep a-comin'. We're the people that live. Can't nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody lick us. We'll go on forever Pa. We're the people. 
830,I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit. <BR> To what? Virgins? <BR> Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that it's like lately during sex I start dreaming about these complex fantasies. <BR> What do you mean? <BR> I mean I'm dreaming about going all out crazy shit. <BR> You mean like fucking two virgins at once. <BR> That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen. <BR> She's probably smash you in the fucking face. <BR> I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect. <BR> Did you tell her that you loved her? <BR> Like. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin seduction guys.
831,Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm! <BR> Oh you want out of hell huh?
832,So you are Dr. Kynes the Imperial Ecologist? <BR> I prefer the more ancient term planetologist... Noble Born. <BR> This is my son Paul.
833,Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it? <BR> Sure.
834,"... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you. <BR> Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it? <BR> Don't be too proud; never be too proud to go on your knees before God."
835,Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay... <BR> Somebody's getting comfortable.
836,Hi Sam. <BR> I mean you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are... <BR> Oh... <BR> ...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind? <BR> It's just for a little while Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there. <BR> I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again  I'll f- I'll f- <BR> She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while. <BR> I should have - <BR> I mean she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up. <BR> Listen to me listen to me listen to me.  Listen you fuckin' cunt. <BR> Oh sh- <BR> Listen to me. <BR> Fuck you. <BR> Let me tell you something.  Listen to me. <BR> I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up. <BR> You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again you ever do anything like that again I'll fuckin' kill you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple I'll fuckin' kill you you bitch. <BR> Why don't you just let me go Sam? <BR> You fuckin' whore! <BR> I'll sign anything you want me to sign okay? <BR> You understand? What? Let you go? <BR> I just want the key to my jewelry and I want you to let me go. <BR> You want your jewelry? <BR> I want you to let me go. <BR> And what? And let you disgrace me you fuckin' pig? And let you disgrace me?  Get up. Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house...
837,Maybe it would do us both good. <BR> There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
838,...thanks Natalie. <BR> ...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
839,Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ? <BR> Eh? In here!
840,What? What don't I get?  What don't I get? <BR> I don't know dude. <BR> That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me! <BR> I thought she wasn't your girlfriend dude. <BR> She's Not! But if she WAS it would be THAT little asshole who's fucking it up for me!
841,Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant? <BR> Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
842,How'd you know it was me? <BR> Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale.  If I had a good enough hint.
843,I've got a thing about places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like. <BR> Your aunt?
844,Howya doin'!  New York treating you okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all-- <BR> 
845,I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay Sid? <BR> You're not allowed to ask that. <BR> I'll stop by the Deltas tonight. <BR> Thanks Joel.
846,He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street... <BR> Hows the boy doing? <BR> Fine... <BR> Good. You neednt worry about the Austrian anymore. Hes dead. Ill be in touch.
847,And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...? <BR> No he got hit by a bus. <BR> Oh... Can I help you? <BR> Well that depends. Do you have a bathroom? <BR> Um... yeah but it's for employees only. <BR> I understand but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent. <BR> Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler. <BR> Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there? <BR> The white kind. <BR> I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony? <BR> Actually it is kind of rough. <BR> Rough eh? Oh that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff. <BR> Yeah but... <BR> Aw c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough. <BR> Yeah okay. Go ahead. <BR> Thanks son you're a lifesaver.
848,Thirty-seven! <BR> Shut up!  Yes I've calmed down I'm still not happy about it but I've been able to deal.
849, <BR> Mitch. <BR> So I was replaced by Mitch? <BR> No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by Mitch...
850,You're staring at me. <BR> I wasn't star-- <BR> I've been thinking Ben about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens. <BR> That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him. <BR> I did but -- somebody should probably see her talk to her... You think she's ok? <BR> Why shouldn't she be?
851,But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned. <BR> Who? <BR> The Queen Mother.  Anne.
852,Yeah. <BR> You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything for that matter that I have not just given you. <BR> Keys. <BR> What? <BR> What about my keys? <BR> You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming? <BR> Yes.
853,"Scully... <BR> Scully, I found the bomb. <BR> Where are you, Mulder? <BR> I'm in the vending room."
854,You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit ... <BR>  <BR> Shadow games ... <BR> You spread it out by the 2nd night the heat are onto you. Know something's up. With a one-night boost by the time all the cars are reported stolen your ship's set sail.
855,So why didn't you kill me then? <BR> She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
856,Need any help? <BR> To put me to bed? Take my clothes off hold my head tuck me in turn off the lights tiptoe out...? eve would. Wouldn't you Eve?
857, <BR> We'll work on it.  I say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and that's all there is to it.
858,What do you mean No Mrs De Moraes? <BR> My brother hung himself. <BR> Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? Hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband. <BR> Leon hung himself. <BR> Adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest didnt he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that but a Brazilian... <BR> Leon hung himself... <BR> Leons not found your parents worry talk of hiring help to find him even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics takes control brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward not before Leons found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned Id exceeded his expectations. <BR> Leon hung himself... <BR> Leon didnt hang himself Deborah. Your husband killed him and made his death look like suicide. How did he do it eh? Strangulation? Drugs? No doubt an autopsy will tell.
859,You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's? <BR> Hell yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ... <BR> Buy you a drink? <BR> Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend.
860,What you couldn't have just left the thing in your car? <BR> It sticks out so I can't lock it. Look Angelo you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this. <BR> Johnny all I can say is we better come up with something real soon.
861,Where's Mother? <BR> Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
862,For Shelly taking the money was a way to take from Caesar.  He could have run at any time but he didn't because he didn't want out. <BR> Sounds like he wanted to get caught. <BR> Maybe he did.  He would brag to me all the time.  He was never afraid of Caesar because he didn't know him.  Not like I do.
863, <BR> A seminal film. First ever depiction of a fully nude triple impalement.
864,What -- ? <BR> Nothing. Just that if I was less secure I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me... <BR> She does have one thing you don't. <BR> What's that? <BR> Bench seats.
865,James. This is my editor Terry Crabtree. <BR> James'll know about George Sanders.
866,Business or pleasure Mr. Price? <BR> My wife. Where were we? <BR>  <BR> Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness.
867,Dude this is seriously lame. I didn't know we were gonna get all dirty and stuff. <BR> Sheet!
868,That's the call that I'm waiting for. <BR> What does it mean? <BR> They want to settle.  It means a lot of money. <BR> Does that mean I'm back for awhile?

877,Where does Dickie live? <BR> We passed it a few blocks back where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie -- <BR> Perhaps I shouldn't go either. <BR> No well go if you want to but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck Marge. I'll catch up with you later.

I like spending time with you. You know you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer. <BR> This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you. <BR> Don't be insecure Doc. You're a big help.
879,How did it happen? <BR> Been meaning to talk to you about that. <BR> Maybe putting your nose in other people's business? <BR> More like other people putting their business in my nose.
880,When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this? <BR> Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there? <BR> Unless he's dumber than I think he won't wait 'til his lease is up.
881,Money makes money Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process. <BR> You're one man. You can't save everybody. <BR> What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one?

884,The families... want your ticket. Turn it in we forget the whole thing.  Everybody goes home. <BR> ... Absolutely not. <BR> The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable. <BR> I am accountable.
885,How's Brad? <BR> A wreck. <BR> Check.  The quacks are willing tools? <BR> Fools! <BR> I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours. <BR> Time to check with Flavors.
886,Good night kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already. <BR> Good night Daddy.
887,No no of course not. You are young... <BR> I'm not jealous! <BR> It's clear you are and it irks me. <BR> No. Yes I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams make the sea sing your name... <BR> A lovestruck page! <BR> Shh... yes yes. Sit with me please... Morgana.
888,We're due at Andrews.  <BR> Well I wouldn't go up in it lest I had to...

894,That's exactly what we wanted to hear. <BR> Oh good. <BR> I wonder is it too late for us to have a look around? <BR> I don't think so. Be happy to show you. <BR> Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own? <BR> Just if you will confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime. <BR> We understand c'mon sweetheart.
895,Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture take your time. I wish I had. <BR> That's our plan. <BR> Well I just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so I can get the ball rolling.
896,I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie. <BR> I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and... <BR> I'll be perfectly honest with you Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you but... <BR> But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car? <BR> No M'am. I was only about to say I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all. <BR> I'd like to be ready when he gets back. <BR> Okay. If you'll come along...

898,She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait. <BR> Yes. <BR>  <BR> Yes. <BR> She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long? <BR> Yes. <BR> Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough.
899,I can't. I got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and I haven't slept and--  Where to -- ? <BR> I dunno. I know a place.
900,Hey  it's the big A.M.. <BR> Rene's been telling me about your work.
901,I like you Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich. <BR> Thanks Principal Merkin. <BR> I'll be blunt. I know you can take it. <BR> Yes sir. I'll brace myself. <BR> Ted you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you. <BR> You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire? <BR> That's a good start yes. A very good start. <BR> Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded heterosexual male's dream. <BR> I never figured you for a pimp. <BR>  <BR> What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing. <BR> I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you then?
902,Special Agent Utah this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes the surfboard bothers me.  Yes your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes you bother me.

Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me? <BR> Caught my first tube this morning.
903,Where'd you get that limp? <BR> Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.
904,How is the house? <BR> Terrible. After this no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz. <BR> If the house is empty again I don't know -- <BR> When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
905,Christ Crabs what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma. <BR> Tripp. <BR> Yes. <BR> Hit your brakes.
906,When did Harp say they'd have the warrant? <BR> He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight it could be an interesting morning.
907,All right now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent. <BR> This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it. <BR> Hey neither did ET; but that was a great movie right?
908,And I always knew I could count on you Agent Utah. <BR> I'm not FBI anymore. <BR> You never were... <BR> I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
909,"What? <BR> I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks. <BR> We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence -- <BR> -- of what exactly?! <BR> That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself. <BR> They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks. <BR> Yeah, well they may this one. <BR> What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here? <BR> This virus -- it...  <BR> Mulder -- <BR> It may be extraterrestrial. <BR> I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder. <BR> Been where? <BR> Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --"
910,What do you do? <BR> Well I've been away for a bit travelling that sort of thing and now I'm trying to write a novel. <BR> What's it about? <BR> A priest who dies. <BR> I see. <BR> Yeah. Well maybe I'll change it. <BR> No. <BR> Yes I mean who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy some guy who's not a priest who doesn't die. You see it's better already. <BR> Writing seems easy. <BR> It's a breeze.
911,So whenever we want... <BR> Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell. <BR> So you're our own private guy? <BR> I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff. <BR> You know my pager number? <BR> No. What is it? <BR> I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is? <BR> The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.
912,Yes? <BR> Would you be willing to stake your life on it? <BR> I think so... <BR> How about --
913,Sure thing. <BR> Curly where's your car? <BR> In the garage. <BR> Where's that? <BR> Off the alley. <BR> Could you drive me somewhere? <BR> Sure as soon as we eat. <BR> Right now Curly. It can't wait. <BR> I'll just tell my wife. <BR> Tell her later.

918,Where do we find a carozza for the Forum or can we hire any of them -- ? <BR> Relax. <BR> It's just there's so much to do in a single day. <BR> Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation. <BR> Freddie? <BR> Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
919,Did you watch it yet? <BR> Sure did. I'll tell you if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort... <BR> Yep. Hey I got a surprise for tonight.

922,Maybe. Maybe twenny days work maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it. <BR> Whatsa matter Ma? Gettin' scared? <BR> No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared. <BR> Watch me pass that Chevvy.
923,All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa. <BR> The one in your office? It's the best one for naps. <BR> I don't think it really matters Hannah. We could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point.
924,"Where'd you get all this? <BR> I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal. <BR> You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job? <BR> It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life! <BR> We gotta get back soon..."

937,Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.  It's a big deal isn't it?  That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before? <BR> Yeah twice. <BR> What happened? <BR> Not much really.  Caesar was nervous kept cleaning the apartment.  |The first time he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
938,Boyd you idiot the shit's coming down! <BR> What does that mean? <BR> You got us into this mess. <BR> Oh I did?

969,Look--why would the Republicans do it? --my God McGovern is self- destructing before our eyes--just like Muskie did Humphrey the bunch of 'em.  Why would the burglars have put the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to get caught? Why did they take a walkie- talkie and then turn it off unless they wanted to get caught? Why would they use McCord--the only direct contact to the Republicans? <BR> You saying the Democrats bugged themselves? <BR> The FBI thinks it's possible--the Democrats need a campaign issue corruption's always a good one.  Get off the story Ben--or put some people on McGovern's finances; fair is fair even in our business.

What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no not me! <BR> What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat? <BR> It isn't cheap. It's nice. <BR> Listen Stew baby let's not talk about things like that now <BR> Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me Anne but I will not live <BR> Oh I love that nose. It's such a sweet nose.

Jesus Christ what are friends for? <BR> All right I owe you one Marv. <BR> That's right next time a little birdie talks to you talk to me too E.F. Hutton.
982,Hello Rick. <BR> Hello Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot? <BR> Fine but I would like to buy your cafe. <BR> It's not for sale. <BR> You haven't heard my offer. <BR> It's not for sale at any price. <BR> What do you want for Sam? <BR> I don't buy or sell human beings. <BR> That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market. <BR> Suppose you run your business and let me run mine. <BR> Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change. <BR> Suppose we do. <BR> My dear Rick when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy?
983,Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing? <BR> From your lips to God's ears. <BR> You go first. <BR> Ladies first.  I insist. <BR> Well. The prom's coming up. <BR> Yeah? <BR> And I was wondering. <BR> Yeah? <BR> If you don't have...I mean...
984,Ahem. As I was saying perhaps another macaroon ... <BR> Thank you Steed.
985,From now on you just shut up and do as you're told. <BR> If I hadn't killed Beynon. you would have.
986,While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there with whatzizname? <BR> Yeah. <BR> She's grown up some hasn't she? <BR> Oh Jesus lay off will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already so lay off a little for Christ's sake.
987,Why didn't you tell me? <BR> There wasn't any way to explain it. <BR> Yeah. <BR> You sent me to him. <BR> When I got out why didn't you tell me where it was? <BR> What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore? <BR> Who's she? <BR> She's on TV. <BR> If you don't start telling the truth...  <BR> What do we do? <BR> We keep going.
988, <BR> Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing? <BR> 
989,Oh wow.  Oh wow.  Oh wow. <BR> You were having a nightmare.

992,Why thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you. <BR> That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
993,John I think you could get with the program a little.  The police are here now.  It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy... <BR> Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans listen to me that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are but I do --
994,You're one of the best Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you. <BR> Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us! <BR> That's true. <BR> Nobody's asked for me have they? <BR> Nobody special enough Curly. <BR> You mean somebody asked? <BR> Only the right people can have you Curly.
995,He's writing his name in water. <BR> What's that? <BR> Like most editors he really wants to be a writer but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one. <BR> That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit. <BR> He'd call it habit. But now... I get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit.
996,No I didn't think so. <BR> Leav't alone.  Wha'd television ever do to you?  Ate your <u>life</u> ruin'd your <u>Culture</u> but...
997,When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands do you then summon hellfire? <BR> I mean what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
998,He's in the dumps sir.  Agnew.  Every time you have him attack the press they give it back to him in spades. He's become the most hated man in America. <BR> Yeah good old Spiro.  Well better him than me.  What the hell is he but an insurance policy?
999,BRAD! <BR> Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care. <BR> I never signed the contract.  He's not going anywhere.
1000,I hired an old casino pal Billy Sherbert as my manager and I went to work. <BR> ...And this is Ronnie who takes care of the card room... <BR> For guys like me Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's a morality car wash. It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples. And along with making us legit...
1001,Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp? <BR> Ah wear whatever you want.
1002,That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs and I sorted your shells and mixed your cocktails and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up I felt like swimming right back to you. <BR> Yes.  Now about our date for tonight... <BR> I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show. <BR> I'm afraid not.  I can't make it tonight. <BR> Tomorrow night? <BR> Not tomorrow either.  You see I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away. <BR> Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected. <BR> You see we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger. <BR> A merger?  How long will you be gone? <BR> Quite a while.  As a matter of fact I'm not coming back at all. <BR> You're not? <BR> It's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter and - <BR> Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty? <BR> According to our tax advisers she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings - <BR> Oh of course.  I understand.  At least I think I do. <BR> I knew you would.
1003,Get in Auggie. I've got something to show you. <BR> You don't give up do you? <BR> Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me. <BR> Where to? <BR> Dammit Auggie don't ask so many questions. Just get in the car.
1004,What is it with you man what the hell is it? <BR> Cat ah!  Ayip! <BR> You're ayip! <BR> Look you don't fuck with me I don't fuck with you right? <BR> But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea.  You rip us off on the hash. <BR> I make special tea for you Hiyes okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together. <BR> Oh shove it Ziat for all the money you have you have nothing!

1007,`Why doesn't he come live with us?' Because everything is here. <BR> I know Pop. <BR> I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here. <BR> I think the building's okay. At least for the time being. <BR> You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon. <BR> Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that. <BR> You tell your friends your father used to work the docks. Callused hands. But you had an attitude when you were growing up that wasn't easy for your mother and me to understand.
1008,Yeah I got it all worked out. Billy listen to me.  That old guard likes you You drop some acid on him.  When he's Seeing rainbows yer know. walk out - tonight. <BR> Then we're outside the kogus. Then what? <BR> What? <BR> After we're outside the kogus? <BR> Oh we... we... <BR> Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire...

I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.
1013,How do you do? <BR> How do you do? <BR> One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca. <BR> And about Victor Laszlo everywhere. <BR> Won't you join us for a drink?
1014,I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'. <BR> You think so Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
1015,Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job. <BR> But then I won't need your money. <BR> That's right.
1016,A User? <BR> That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter Sark? You look nervous.
1017,Remember the onramp?  There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van. <BR> 
1018,Six to the left. One to the right. <BR> He's on vacation. <BR> We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.
1019,Tom? <BR> Marge I'm in the bath. Won't be long. <BR> Tom I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
1020,Okay let's go through what happened. We're in the place everything's going fine. Then the alarm gets tripped. I turn around and all these cops are outside. You're right it was like bam! I blink my eyes are they're there. Everybody starts going apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin' all the - <BR> That's not correct. <BR> What's wrong with it? <BR> The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone. <BR> As soon as I heard the alarm I saw the cops. <BR> I'm telling ya it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that can't you Mr. White? <BR>  <BR> Don't tell me your name I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine. <BR> You're right this is bad.  How did you get out? <BR> Shot my way out. Everybody was shooting so I just blasted my way outta there.
1021,We can't touch Hoover -- <BR> I thought the gloves were off. <BR> -- as long as he's got secret files on everybody.  I don't want 'em used against us.  What about the CIA?  Helms's done nothing for us.  I want to see him.
1022,Who? <BR> Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
1023,What part of Dixie are you from Duane? <BR> Georgia. In case I didn't tell you it's cash only gentlemen.
1024,I resign. <BR> You need treatment Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign. <BR> Watch me.
1025,Julie wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again. <BR> I'm not going anywhere Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams. <BR> I decided to let Helen run the magazine. I need to go to college learn a few things you know.
1026,You know it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. You know what I'm talking about? <BR> He's screaming his opinions in my ear. <BR> Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon I found it incredibly... indulgent. You know he really is. He's one of the most indulgent film makers. He really is- <BR>  <BR> without getting... well let's put it this way... <BR> What are you depressed about?
1027,Well we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece. <BR> And of course we are. <BR> Well you never can tell these days can you?

1031,Where does one man get all this junk? <BR> All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas. <BR> Holy shit...
1032,"Answer me this. What makes a man become a producer? <BR> What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair? <BR> This answer satisfies me a hundred percent. <BR> We all have abnormality in common. We are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity, we Theater folk. We are the original displaced personalities..."
1033,"You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards! <BR> That'll be the day!...Let's ride."
1034,Yah no I'm kinda - I'm kinda busy - <BR> I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short then. I'm on my way out of town but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here. <BR> No I -
1035,So what brings you to a dive like this? <BR> It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little. <BR> How old kid?
1036,Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack take out your bag of money count out five thousand dollars and hand it over to Auggie. <BR> What are you talking about?  You can't be serious. <BR> I'm serious all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies. <BR> I'm not going to do it. <BR> You'll do it all right. You fuck up you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works buster. If you don't do it I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you. <BR> I pay Auggie and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City. <BR> Don't worry about it. You've got friends now remember? Just behave yourself and everything will work out.
1037,"We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive. <BR> I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg."
1038,We thought if you didn't mind we'd go out to the motel with you. <BR> He's already been.
1039,Right here's fine. <BR> Is that the woman from..? <BR> She really liked the kitchen.
1040,What's wrong? <BR> We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer catch the incoming tide.
1041,Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio? <BR> He is not in the car.  Sorry.
1042,I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry remember. <BR> Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge Daddy. <BR> Yeah. <BR> Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
1043,"I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know. <BR> Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you? <BR> Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin. <BR> Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill. <BR> It's okay, Mom.  Trust me."
1044,But the million bucks each that's for real? <BR> It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!

1050,It's good nobody is following us ... <BR> It's a question of habit ...
1051,"How come you have to tell them that? <BR> Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news."
1052,"Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you? <BR> I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me. <BR> If you didn't want me chasing him, you shouldn't have taken me to that funeral home."

I got it all written up. Ready to go. All I want is a thousand dollars.
1057,Encourage them to be bolder. <BR> The only thing left for them is the City Grid...  ...They may not do it.
1058,I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage. <BR> Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.
1059, <BR> Alex I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it... <BR> It is. <BR> How?!  It's a machine Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program a brilliant program it was designed so it would act as if it were alive but it's not alive. <BR> So how did it know my name then? <BR> You imagined it.

1066,How could you do this to me? <BR> I'm in love with you. <BR> Oh come on...  What kind of an excuse is that?
1067,Better go.  Grierson hates people being late. <BR> Yes.  Ahm... think I'11 ...
1068,Boy those guys in the French Resistance were really brave you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much. <BR> M'm I don't know sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture. <BR> You? You kiddin'?

1071,Masseria's confused. He can't figure whether you're workin' for Maranzano or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. So he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after Profaci because it happened on his turf. I figure Masseria's gonna try to rub out Profaci and pin it on us. Then Maranzano will have to kill ya. <BR> You got men on Profaci's place? <BR> We got our boys paintin' the house next door. Around the clock. We're gonna keep old man Profaci alive if it takes twenty coats.
1072,All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish? <BR> They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples for DNA with that Nick's tapes and the rest of you to back me up it should stand when we get back. <BR> Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.  I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now.  This expedition is over.
1073,Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys? <BR> I suppose so. He never told me about it. <BR> No wonder he was angry. <BR> He was out five thousand bucks he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....
1074,For what it's worth I'm sorry. <BR> You make it sound like I'm already dead.
1075,Evelyn could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it. <BR> Best of a nightmare.
1076,A mortician.  He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us. <BR> Should we knock? <BR> He probably already knows we're coming.
1077,Hi. <BR> Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
1078,Somebody has to. <BR> Same old Daniel. <BR> Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien but on the inside nothing is the same. <BR> Is that so? <BR> Oh yeah.  See Susie a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man. <BR> The big house? <BR> The big house. <BR> Jesus Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals. <BR> A cage by any other name would still smell like sweaty ugly men.
1079,Sleep.  It'll be light soon. <BR> Okay.  Talk some more. <BR> About what? <BR> About where you're from.
1080,What are you doing here? <BR> Didn't you call? <BR> How do you happen to know her? <BR> I don't. <BR> Let me show you something.

I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty. <BR> No no. Not at my hotel. I uh I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station huh? <BR> All right. At a quarter to five.  Say why don't we get married in Marseilles?
1083,This is Matt Hooper... <BR> I know who he is... <BR> He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
1084,You guys are my parents. <BR> Of course we are. <BR> They didn't want me when I was born. Why should I care...
1085,Mr. President we are in a revolutionary situation.  We are under siege -- Black Panthers Weathermen; The State Department under Rogers is leaking like a sieve.  And now this insignificant little shit Ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy. <BR> Here Tim ... Tim.  I'm as frustrated as you Henry but don't you think this one's a Democrat problem.  They started the war; it makes them look bad.
1086,You know havin' some fun with it shit like that. <BR> Where the hell did you learn how to deal?  <BR> He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon. <BR> Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
1087,I uh I didn't finish I... fell asleep. <BR> That good huh? <BR> No it's not that it's...
1088,I said 'Next time phone ahead.' <BR> Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons I don't call ahead for an appointment. <BR> What the hell are you talking about? <BR> I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation. <BR> Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it Whitehouse? You're nuts? <BR> Yesterday morning you passed a stopped school bus which was flashing its lights then you-- <BR> Hold on! <BR> Don't ever put your hands on me Mr. Gordon. <BR> You're talking about a goddamned ticket from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something? <BR> Don't give me a hard time Mr. Gordon. I'm just -- <BR> Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too. <BR> Yes. Here's your ticket. <BR> You get the hell out of my house now asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call and I'm pissed enough to do it now!
1089,The Jacket. That's what they call it right? <BR> Yeah. <BR> It was banned you know... and it led to an investigation of Dr. Becker's mistreatment of some of his patients. That's when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients...
1090,HOLY SHIT!! <BR> You okay? <BR> Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?! <BR> God yes Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever... <BR> Holy shit. Holy...
1091,Why is Junior's watch in that coffin? Something stinks around here. <BR> Your time is up busyboy. <BR> Who identified the body? <BR> The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality. <BR> I'm the next of kin. I should've seen him.
1092,After we ID we bury the body. Case and casket closed. <BR> You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in. <BR> It's splitsville for you.
1093,You gave them a fresh taste of blood! <BR> They will never be satisfied with anything else Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!
1094,This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead? <BR> I never heard nothin' about it.
1095,Thanks for the note--you're right I wasn't bending my back. <BR> You got a live arm there.
1096,Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts  you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett.. <BR> Tony Bennett... What do you mean? <BR> Singing on stage and painting in your spare time. <BR> I didn't know Tony Bennett painted. <BR> My point exactly.
1097,Thank you. <BR> Look I know this sounds corny but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism but - <BR> Oh cut the shit Kathryn. <BR> Excuse me? <BR> You heard me. <BR> Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead have some respect. <BR> Kathryn I know all about you and Sebastian. <BR> Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he - <BR> I have his journal. <BR> You what? <BR> His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs the hand jobs the menages your bout with bulimia the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix don't you? It's all in there. <BR> You didn't show it to anybody? <BR> Actually I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride? <BR> You can't do this to me. It could ruin me. <BR> I know.
1098,Can't you stop these things?! <BR> Sorry!  It's kind of a ride! <BR> Let's get outta here!
1099,"Want a drink? I'm having one. <BR> A shot of tequila, if you can spare it. <BR> Of course."
1100,You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out... <BR> A little to the left... <BR> I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next... <BR> Line it up now nice and easy...
1101,Do I need to repeat myself? <BR> No Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
1102,Listen to me Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on. <BR> Fuck you! <BR> This motherfucker do you believe this? Two fuckin' days and nights!  Fuck me?
1103,Beautiful night. <BR> Yeah. <BR> Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel. <BR> No problem. What's on your mind? <BR> Well now here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya? <BR> Whatever. <BR> A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with? <BR> Sure. <BR> Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right? <BR> I agree with what you said...truly. <BR> What did I say? <BR> That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be. <BR> So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life. <BR> How's that?
1104,No! That's his table. <BR> You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now.
1105,Is he cute? <BR> He's okay. <BR> Should I fuck him? <BR> I don't know. Do whatever you want. <BR> He's great right. Is he great? <BR> He's alright. <BR> I know. <BR> But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need.
1106,"Beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing... <BR> She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points. <BR> Think she means for us to follow? <BR> How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!"
1107,So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real. <BR> There are worse things than vampires out there. <BR> Like what? <BR> Like me.
1108,--if he did it or just said he did it God knows. <BR> I could care less about where it happened; what happened is what counts.  Put him on.  Ken I'm sorry it was Goddamn Beirut and they were having a crisis what's up kid?  Slow down Ken you sound frazzled.  A wife and a family and a cat and a dog right Ken.  Ken I would never print that you were in Marilyn's apartment at night-- unless of course you force me to.
1109,The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein. <BR> Was I at that dinner? Just tell me - <BR> You were wandering around. <BR> Was I at that dinner? <BR> You were wandering around. <BR> Was I at that dinner? <BR> You were wandering around. <BR> Was I at that dinner? <BR> You were in the m- You were in the building. <BR> I was in the building!
1110,You've got it all figured. <BR> No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on. <BR> Like what?
1111,YOU'RE KILLING HIM! <BR> They'll get in! We'll all die!
1112,He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have buried him. I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby. And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me. <BR> No he wouldn't. I would have.  And he'd've been right too. I mean seriously.  Well there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off. <BR> I didn't.  I didn't. I mean I did but then I did exactly what you told me to do and I came right back. <BR> You did. You're right. <BR> Exactly.
1113,Was that cannon fire or is it my heart pounding? <BR> Ah that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound only about thirty-five miles away.
1114, <BR> As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that. <BR> The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe the three hundred fifty thousand that's true? <BR> No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand. <BR> And as treasurer you could release those funds? <BR> When so ordered. <BR> We're not sure we've got all the guys who could order you but we know there were five. 
1115,Hey Junebug when all this is over we should get the band back together again. <BR> Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go. <BR> We could get back together too. <BR> Were we together?
1116,Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now... <BR> I'll see you soon --
1117,Got me an audition tonight. <BR> Well you just remember if you can't kick front kick back 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes okay?
1118,... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that too. <BR> You know she probably means well after all... <BR> She is a louse.
1119,I've been backpacking. <BR> I don't know how to translate that.  E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto con un...
1120,'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a position to 'dis' or 'give props' or whatever your Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're wallpaper. You're not here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And who the fuck told you 'Red Dragon'?. <BR> We get it. We're sorry. <BR> Now that Limey motherfucker's jumpy and wants to change shit around on me. Maxie's gonna shit a Nokia when he hears about... Aw shit I better call him before he hears.
1121,What's happening? <BR> They don't look happy...something's gone wrong. <BR> The police...? <BR> John. <BR> John?  Christ he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing? <BR> How about his job? <BR> His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him they might let us go...at least we have a chance... <BR> Tell that to Mr. Takagi.
1122,Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check. <BR> A check?
1123,Tribuus!  Go left here I want to see my new statue at Via Claudia. <BR> Yes Caesar. <BR> We need more statues -- perhaps I should open medical clinics.  For the poor.  Citizens only though...
1124,Why didn't you kill her? <BR> Why didn't you kill him?
1125,Uhhhh... <BR> What? <BR> Okay -- I'll admit it: I'm totally clinically insane. But I'm still the only one who actually got a check tonight. It's yours -- if you just get me the hell out of here now.
1126,You know something lady if you sold life insurance I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds. <BR> Oh thank you I knew you'd understand.
1127,Show me the other one again.  I like them both. <BR> I'll take them both.
1128,"In any event, you still owe me my reward. <BR> I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers."
1129,How do you know there is a Grand Hotel? <BR> Oh there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.
1130,I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me. <BR> I did. You said things were fine. <BR> I remember. <BR> This is the night you met Clementine Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought oh shit. <BR> Yeah you told me that later. <BR> I told you that later.
1131,Your Majesty... <BR> How goes that favor I asked of you? <BR> I grow closer to my target your Majesty. <BR> You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General and you will have a palace of your own.
1132,Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that? <BR> Yeah I heard yeah. <BR> Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it. <BR> I know. <BR> It's in all the papers. <BR> What're you gonna do? <BR> And I mean... that's no good. <BR> I know. <BR> You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better. <BR> I'll tell him Remo.
1133,We've progressed emotionally in -- <BR> Baloney! Once it was see somebody get excited get married -- Now it's read books fence with four syllable words psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam <BR> People have different emotional levels that -- <BR> Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz!
1134,I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency. <BR> Perhaps not.
1135,Why do you look at me like that? <BR> I did not know you were so beautiful... and -- <BR> And then --? <BR> No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever. <BR> And -- and -- <BR> How tired you are! <BR> Yes -- tired... <BR> So alone. <BR> Alone. All alone.  Oh you strange -- strange creature. <BR> You mustn't talk Russian to me. <BR> Strange man... <BR> Am I quite strange to you? <BR> Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know once when the Grand Duke was alive I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer -- <BR> And...? <BR> He disappeared. Later he was found dead. <BR> I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone.  <BR> Go away. Who are you --? <BR> A man who could love -- that is all who has forgotten everything else for you. <BR> You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me? <BR> I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya... <BR> Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand. <BR> Yes -- I do understand. <BR> I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor. <BR> I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here? <BR> I want to be alone. <BR> That is not so -- you don't want to be alone.  <BR> I want to be alone -- <BR> No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you you'd feel worse than you did before You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me. <BR> Just for a minute then.
1136,You've got your ten levels right? Here they are...  Each level has an exit only remember the exits aren't always what they seem.  First one's The Blood Red Sky then you've got The Blue Desert Tower of Ghosts Kingdom of the Blind...  On each world you have to find a golden key and you've only got so much time to do it in.  If you're too late The Screamer comes. <BR> How do you stop The Screamer? <BR> You can't.  He gets you and you're dead. It's like time catching up with you you know?  Like Fate.  Each level you get progressively less time to complete.  First half of the game takes place in the Wild Lands.  Then you reach Level 6 and that's the Sea of Darkness.  There's a two-headed Boatman that'll take you across if you answer his riddle right.  If you don't...
1137,This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time. <BR> Money doesn't matter to me Mr. Gittes.
1138,Oh I'm sorry. <BR> It's okay. It's not that hot anymore. Thanks God.
1139,That was a pair bond!  A family group even long after that infant was nestbound! <BR> I want to see the nesting ground!
1140,Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous. <BR> And then...
1141,My dad's down there! <BR> He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
1142,So you're a waitress right? I mean...from the uniform you were wearing. <BR> Yup. That's me. <BR> You like it? <BR> [Beat] I do it. <BR> Have you always been a waitress?
1143,I will not die because of him! <BR> Don't be stupid drop the gun!
1144,Sure you want to keep those in the house? <BR> I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason. <BR> I thought it was funny.
1145,Oh. Hi. <BR> I didn't see you this morning. <BR> Look I'm kind of in a hurry. <BR> I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you. <BR> Hello.
1146,I bet you didn't know that you and Junior have something in common Theo: Junior can't bowl anymore either. Isn't that right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup bottle down on Junior's right hand. The table settings jump from the shock. Junior sits impassively his face a blank. <BR> See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand Junior. <BR> After we eat Dad. <BR> He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
1147,What kinds questions did Cabot ask? <BR> Where I was from who I knew how I knew Nice Guy had I done time shit like that.
1148,Forget that ... <BR> Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?

1152,Hi.  Are you calling from jail? <BR> Not yet. <BR> Well the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation? <BR> I'm working on it I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you. <BR> That's sweet. <BR> Well I do. <BR> Well you should. <BR> What are you doing? <BR> Just a bit of organizing. <BR> Nesting? <BR> Yeah. Nesting. <BR> I'm mad at you. <BR> Go have fun. Not too much. <BR> I'll see you tomorrow...
1153,Can I ask you a question? <BR> Sure. <BR> When I die.  Is it gonna hurt? <BR> I...I don't know.
1154,Okay shitbag. Im only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman? <BR> Who?  I dont know who the fuck youre talking about sunshine. <BR> Gluck. <BR> Figlio di puttana. Youre the French asshole who bumped off the London guys... <BR> Five seconds. Then you die. <BR> Fuck... <BR> Three... <BR> Glucks dead you sonofabitch!
1155,Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions. <BR> What about? <BR> It's about the burglary. <BR> Burglary? <BR> Downstairs. <BR> Of course. <BR> Can we come in?
1156,And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor stands up and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz. <BR> Simple math Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three. <BR> Miles I've always been on the square with you. <BR> I'm sure you have Buzz. <BR> Wish me luck.
1157,How ya doin'? <BR> Mr. Mohra? <BR> Yah. <BR> Officer Olson. <BR> Yah right-o.
1158, <BR> Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party? <BR> Some say you are Rocky. <BR> The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run now did he?
1159,Carlos can I ask you something? <BR> Sure. <BR> Nothing. <BR> Ask me. Ask me anything. <BR> Did you ever... Do you have feelings for Anna?
1160,Would you like me to leave...?  Is this a bad time -- ? <BR> What...? <BR> Is this a bad time. <BR> We we... No... we just had a small reversal in the case...  I have some uh... I have some work to do... <BR> What happened...? <BR> They uh they got to my witness. <BR> ...and is that serious?
1161,What did you do the my kids!! <BR> Me?? <BR> No! The man in the moon!! Who's driving this thing?
1162,Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you but one way or another I'm going to know. <BR> You won't go to the police if I tell you? <BR> I will if you don't.
1163,Calm down. <BR> I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me. <BR> This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie. <BR> Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school. <BR> I'm sorry... <BR> This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy. <BR> It's gonna be fine. <BR> No more man. <BR> Let's get some sleep. That's what we need man. Sleep. <BR> How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner. <BR> So what do we do? <BR> Let's just go now and wait. <BR> Three and a half hours? <BR> I don't want to take any more chances. <BR> Let's just go get guns I'd feel better. <BR> Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed. <BR> Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish kid's tooth cost him eight grand maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line of clientele? He knows you're fucking up Jess' dancing and I got a feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. He can't kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions. So he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? He can make us disappear out here real nice... <BR> Where do you get this shit? <BR> Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever I don't know where it's coming which way it's coming from I'm telling you one thing right now I'm not gonna be late for the dance. <BR> You're not getting a gun.
1164,I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out. <BR> Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday. <BR> Thanks a lot.
1165,Invitations: the Museum Gala. <BR> No. <BR> The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser. <BR> No. <BR> The Hinchberger wedding. <BR> Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick... <BR> I'll send your regrets.  Honestly why must I even bother? <BR> Because if you don't know about society you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
1166,He must be very nice. <BR> Who? <BR> Whoever is keeping you waiting. <BR> Have you seen it? <BR> Oh my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That?  <BR> That. <BR> You? <BR> Oh -- work!! <BR> Oh! <BR> Dictation.  You know... <BR> Oh... poor child. If you were free I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but -- <BR> Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day I'd hate to spoil it. <BR> Reducing? <BR> No -- why? -- should I? <BR> Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day? <BR> Money -- Ever heard of it? <BR> Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies? <BR> Very little. <BR> Too bad. <BR> Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself? <BR> Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could -- <BR> Aren't you? <BR> What? <BR> Free -- <BR> Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though. <BR> Tomorrow? What time tomorrow? <BR> Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs? <BR> Where downstairs? <BR> Yellow Room where they dance --  <BR> You're very funny -- <BR> Yes? -- Tomorrow? <BR> Of course. <BR> Really?
1167,Lawyers? <BR> Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins...
1168,Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty. He really does. Marge she's got a hundred theories but there are a few things she doesn't know. We hope she never knows. <BR> I hope she never knows. <BR> Three different people saw Dickie get into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't identify himself because he was jumping someone else's wife at the time saw Dickie removing license plates from a red sports car. The Police know about this man because he happens to be a Policeman.
1169,I mean the cops knew but they didn't give a fuck. I mean you know they all worked it out together. <BR> Nicky sends his warmest regards.
1170,-- tearing me -- apart. <BR> I know. Take some of my blood. <BR> No -- <BR> It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
1171,It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'! <BR> I know. <BR> You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?! <BR> I just can't believe it. <BR> This is your moment don't you see? The instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again.  When you stand up and are counted.
1172,The War ain't over.  <BR> I saw it on TV. <BR> The war ain't over til I <u>say</u> it's over.  This is <u>my</u> picture.  You think you're in a <u>spot</u>?  You think this is a tight spot?  Try making the Hunchback of Notre Dame when your three lead actors <u>die</u> two weeks from the end of Principal Photography.  This is... this is... this is just...  Act One:  THE WAR. Act <u>Two</u> ... the... uh...
1173,Grandpa Reaches says you come from heavy Indian blood. I used to think Grandpa was gettin' senile. Now I know he is. <BR> Move it Magdelana.
1174,Jules I want you to say hello to somebody...  I'm on with John - that guy I told you about. <BR> The future guy? <BR> Yeah but no kidding around he's a good guy a real good guy...
1175,White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol. <BR> That's right.
1176,I'll go first. <BR> No -- I will. <BR> I stood up first. <BR> That doesn't matter. <BR> You always get to go first.
1177,We got it. We got it baby. <BR> What? What is it? <BR> There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago. <BR> Is that unusual? <BR> Two weeks ago he bought those 25000 acres. That's unusual.

You might get confused speaking of things you dont understand and we need you clear- headed at least until youve done what we are paying you for. <BR> Now you are confusing me Mrs De Moraes. <BR> Can it be that easy? <BR> Can it be that you want your brother found? <BR> Anything is possible.

1293,A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ... <BR> Global warming? <BR> Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
1294,This is really happening isn't it? <BR> [Beat] What do you need me to do? <BR> [Beat] Thank you.
1295, <BR> I don't buy it. <BR> Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses. <BR> Maybe I don't see it that way. <BR> Oh so it's back to pretending we're human again is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us Blade. You always have been. <BR> You're wrong. <BR> Am I? You think the humans will ever accept a half-breed like you? They can't. They're afraid of you.  The humans fear us because we're superior. They fear us because in their hearts they know their race has become obsolete.
1296,I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes... <BR> ...behind my head. They trust that scumbag I don't.

Guy fucked a twelve- year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off? <BR> What do you think would hold it off? <BR> Uh <u>nothing</u> oh <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u> uh...  You're kidding. <BR> I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me? <BR> I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why... <BR> Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four Forty or Fight.

No that's... <BR> We remember the slogans we can't even remember the fucking <u>wars</u>.  Y'know why.  Cause it's <u>show business</u>. That's why I'm here.  Naked girl covered in Napalm. Five marines Raising the Flag Mount Suribachi. Churchill V for Victory Y'remember the Picture fifty years from now they'll have forgotten  the war.  Gulf War?  Smart Bomb falling through the roof.  2500 missions a day 100 days <u>One Shot</u> of One Bomb.  The American people bought that war. M'I getting through to you?  War in the Balkans don't mean nothing till some G.I. flyer went down Eating Snakes for Ten days. N'then It's show business Mister Moss.  That's why I'm here.
1300,What have we missed? <BR> He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.  I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr. Leeds.
1301,Can we have a hot dog please medium rare and a cup of joe? <BR> You guys are thrashed.
1302,Your pop said to put these on his tab. Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door. <BR> So Buzz let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is waiting. As Buzz gets up Theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs.
1303,I'm having luck for the first time in my life. <BR> Your bank Mr. Kringelein.
1304,Long live the Organization for the Organized! <BR> Sit down Mr. Starks! Sit down Mr. Starks!
1305,Or he'll steal it like his brother. He's a mean little sonofabitch Edgar ... He had the IRS audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home. <BR> I know ...
1306,What's with the fish thing -- ? <BR> We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like well ... <BR> Fish. <BR> And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood. <BR>  <BR> I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ... <BR> You have a Hollandaise sauce ? <BR> I do ...  Christ what happened to us ? <BR> Speak for yourself boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce <BR> No but you dress like an asshole ...
1307,Mental instability? <BR> He was adopted you know. <BR> I'd forgotten. <BR> Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
1308,How old are you now Toby? <BR> Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...
1309,There goes a thousand dollars. <BR> Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars? <BR> That one did. <BR> ... two hundred dollars a toe.

1311,The old man and woman called me... Phillippe. <BR> Phillippe.  Rest now.
1312,Honey go in there and get some Starbursts. <BR> What? <BR> They're screaming for Starbursts. <BR> Later. <BR> They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. Go get some fucking Starbursts.
1313,Yeah! <BR> This is about freedom of speech Stan about censorship.
1314,What? <BR> I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry. <BR> She's alive?
1315,OK get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord. <BR> I did all right on McCord. <BR> Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President otherwise known as CREEP? <BR> The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean? <BR>  <BR> You can't believe that. <BR> As a rough rule of thumb as far as I can throw Bronco Nagurski that's how much I trust John Mitchell...
1316,We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here. <BR> Good idea. <BR> I'll be Elvis and you--
1317,You don't have to do this. I can look after myself. <BR> Have you got your passport? <BR> What? <BR> Shut up. Have you got your passport? <BR> Yes.
1318,Don't worry. Really. Don't worry. <BR> You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't... <BR> No I absolutely understand. Of course. <BR> Otherwise you'd be fighting me off. <BR> Beating you away.
1319,You'll wait in the hall? <BR> I'll wait there. <BR> And if it sounds like I'm being killed you'll phone the police you'll tell them everything? <BR> Everything. <BR> Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood. <BR> Alex. <BR> What? <BR> As smart as you are you'll need a little help.
1320,You did?  How is he? <BR> Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult. <BR> Well... send my love if you see him again.
1321,Is there anything else you want to know? <BR> Where you were when your husband died. <BR> I can't tell you. <BR> You mean you don't know where you were? <BR> I mean I can't tell you. <BR> You were seeing someone too.
1322,What are you laughing at? <BR> I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent but Ralph is awful sweet. <BR> I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you. <BR> I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria. <BR> Did you? Where? <BR> In the can.  The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy. The Pawk Avenue Wintons you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi.  He's in the jail-house now ...
1323,This is just what they want Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together Buddy ... We belong together. <BR> That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
1324,Hardapple? <BR> I could be wrong. What happened anyway? <BR> Huh? Oh someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing. <BR> That's weird. <BR> We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over. <BR> The perpetrator. <BR> No the dog. <BR> Just kidding.
1325,I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me. <BR> No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me. <BR> I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over it's always just a little bit short. <BR> Carrying charges my boy carrying charges. Here sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you anyhow.
1326,And carrying.  The National Flower of Albania something..... Now Is it some Festival?  Some <u>Harvest</u> Festival something... <BR> Get on this right now... <BR> ...got to be <u>something</u>.  She gives him the sacred...  And tells him:  this is the Traditional Harvest Offering given to the Man who Ties the First Sheaf the last sheaf whatever the fuck it is... <BR> ...this's <u>good</u>... <BR> Stanley Moss Ladeesngennlmen... And she says... <BR> Is she saying this in Albanian...? <BR> <u>Yes</u>:  she is saying this in Albanian <u>but</u> she's doing it not to be uh...  But because she explains that is the only way it can be understood by her Aged and Sainted Mother who is standing there with her dressed in her Traditional...
1327,What is it?  What are you? <BR> There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die.  All of us!  I saw it!
1328,What the fuck was that about? <BR> She was jonesing for me.
1329,Tribuus... tomorrow. <BR> You're coming back? <BR> I have to come back.  If I don't come back the people will think I'm a coward.  Tribuus tomorrow he dies -- I want his blood on the sand.  Do you understand?
1330,Yeah? Ain't that something? Middle of a drought the water commissioner drowns. Only in L.A. <BR> Yeah. Banged up pretty bad. <BR> That's a long fall. <BR> So how are you Morty?
1331,415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman. <BR> No.  This isn't what you think. <BR> I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it. <BR> Okay okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio. <BR> You can talk to Julia.  Forget the radio.
1332,You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson. <BR> Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place. <BR> But your life and lands are far from here. <BR> I gave up my castles and my lands!
1333,"He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow... <BR> I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on... <BR> Why? <BR> Because she's my...my... <BR> She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all! <BR> I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own... <BR> That don't make 'em kin... <BR> All right...I ain't got no kin...

1334,Just leave her alone. <BR> I'm so sorry. <BR> Leave her alone.
1335,Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing Miss Sessions just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying? <BR> Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen. <BR> I understand... if you could tell me who employed you Miss Sessions. That could help us both. <BR> Oh no. <BR> ...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over? <BR> No Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times... <BR> The obituary column? <BR> You'll find one of those people. <BR> 'Those people?' Miss Sessions.
1336,That's a canary sir. <BR> That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary huh? Go on get that out of here. Get that out of here! <BR> Yes sir. Very good sir. <BR> A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here! <BR> Yes sir!
1337,Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness? <BR> You use their witness. <BR> That's right. <BR> I think we tried that. The case is over.
1338,Okay. The woman just cant walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why cant you go to your Embassy? <BR> French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didnt have any. I used a British passport. My names not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
1339,A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That must have been nice -- for him. <BR> Only in mutual advantages -- moreover...
1340,...  maybe three hours. <BR> Caesar what are you going to do? <BR> What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money. <BR> What? <BR> Once we have the money then none of this ever happened. <BR> Caesar you just killed Gino Marzzone. <BR> No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up. <BR> What happened to them? <BR> I don't know.  We may never know but I'm going to guess it was a job maybe the Karpoli family.
1341,Sam we got a problem. <BR> What is it? <BR> The little guy. He's half in the bag and nobody told him he was eighty- sixed from the joint so we...
1342,General hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight.  A fan sent them to you. <BR> Alive... I'm alive...
1343,I'll tell you how. Like - let's see - like she was studyin' you like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints. How you walk talk think eat sleep- <BR> I'm sure that's very flattering Birdie and I'm sure there's nothing wrong with that!
1344,I'm so sorry Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really really liked you. <BR> Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is my girlfriend is now living with and possibly engaged to a demented monkey. <BR> You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place and only thinking of her. <BR> Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
1345,That's what I want -- a gaff rig. <BR> Gaff rigged?  Why not a staysail schooner?  Go anywhere.  Look at this -- the Mayan an Alden schooner.
1346,You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this. <BR> You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
1347,I'll call the cops for you.  You've got the number on the fridge right? <BR> Thanks.  Just give them the time he called.  They're keeping a list supposedly.  Sorry.  My nerves are so raw these days. <BR> 'S okay.
1348,They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses the loading docks looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source. <BR> That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead. <BR> No. Every product contains one component. The elements react in combination. Hair spray won't do it. But hair spray and perfume and lipstick will.  Untraceable. It's very elegant.
1349,That's it. Just the two rooms. <BR> This is the first house I've been in without a TV. <BR> I used to have one but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things. <BR> But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan. <BR> I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head remember? <BR> Nice drawing. Did you do that? <BR> My father did. Believe it or not that little baby is me. <BR> Yeah I can believe it. <BR> It's strange though isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were. <BR> Is your father an artist? <BR> No he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble. <BR> He's dead? <BR> Twelve thirteen years ago.  Actually he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend drawing a picture of Mount Greylock. <BR> Drawing's a good thing. <BR> Is that what you do? Draw pictures? <BR> Yeah sometimes.  I like to dabble too.
1350,Please -- <BR> Listen to your father Jason. It's going to be a better world.
1351,What's the matter? <BR> It's all microchips and shit ... <BR> Yeah?
1352,Surprise -- is the most important element of attack.  And beside you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it. <BR> The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls and over-passionate daughters of the rich. <BR> The same. <BR> But he never ends up marrying her. Strange. <BR> Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable? <BR> You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee? <BR> Exactly what I had in mind -- along with some brandy.
1353,Kate you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now. <BR> You miss me?... <BR> Uh yeah.  Sure.  Honey did you forget the guys are coming over tonight? <BR> No why? <BR> Well there's nothing here to eat.
1354,She's been marked for it. The House does that. Happened to Pritchett's father. Likely happen to you all. Isn't that what you told me Mr. Pritchett? <BR> I can't remember at the moment.
1355,He's on all night screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?  He's out of his fuckin' mind. <BR> It's a pity in this...
1356,The well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart. <BR> No. <BR> Why? <BR> I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough. <BR> And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you? <BR> There is one. <BR> Who?! <BR> You. <BR> Me? <BR> Yes. I would swear my love to you. <BR> To me? But why? <BR> I cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend. And in pledging my love to you I cannot love any other woman.
1357,Not even of dying? <BR> No. <BR> You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other? <BR> No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
1358,"What's that, a ship? <BR> You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus..."
1359,Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies. <BR> What are you talking about? <BR> I've seen that kamikaze look Johnny.  You've got it.  And Bodhi can smell it a mile away.  He'll take you to the edge... and past it.  Hey Bodhi.
1360,There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names... <BR> I didn't know your size.
1361,You don't think this is just infatuation do you? <BR> Oh no.  Do you? <BR> No.
1362,Another cup of coffee? <BR> No thanks I'm nervous enough. <BR> I guess it's time to hit the road. <BR> Yeah don't want to be late for my own funeral.
1363,I don't even want to talk but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week I I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head. <BR> Come on. <BR> No. No I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all. <BR> I like you too.
1364,Who? <BR> Your friends. <BR> I don't know what you're talking about.
1365,You're better than I expected. <BR> I was at Harrow ... <BR> But did they teach you this?
1366,Quest-ce que tu veux? <BR> Un Autrichien. Negociant en pré- pubescents.
1367,Right right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive? <BR> Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales. <BR> Right.  Okay...  It's meant to be right?  This is it.
1368,Let's get out there. And have them run down every 167 Shelby Mustang in the area ... Find out where they're at. <BR> What for? <BR> You spend enough time down a man's throat you get to know his tonsils. Do it ...
1369,Hungry? <BR> Just some coffee. <BR> I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie... <BR> Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk. <BR>  <BR> I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested. <BR> She mentioned of course that Margo expects to play the part? <BR> Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo. Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part.
1370,No she's not in. Without waiting for any more he replaces the reciever and walks to the door where he picks up the mail. On his way back from the door David emerges ready to go to work. <BR> Have you seen him? <BR> Alex I don't have the time -- <BR> Yes or no yes or no yes or -- <BR> No.
1371,Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  CRAZY BAT-STARD! <BR> Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep. <BR> Jesus Vicki! Where is it?? <BR> It's gone.
1372,Welcome to Venice. This place reeks doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day. <BR> It's okay. <BR> Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome. <BR> What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome? <BR> That's good isn't it? <BR> No but I thought that didn't happen in Italy that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the -- <BR> You've seen the papers you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered -- <BR> It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe.
1373,God it's so clean out here. <BR> It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
1374,You're looking at the owners of a 50000 acre empire. <BR> They can't be. <BR> They may not know it but they are.
1375,-- what're you talking about? -- <BR> -- we're evacuating the building -- <BR> -- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! -- <BR> -- call the code! -- I want everyone out! -- <BR> -- you gotta give me more to go on -- <BR> -- he's running from the cops he's got a bag filled with God knows what he's in the building and I don't know where! --
1376,H'm I'm sorry I can't go through with this because it-I can't get it off my mind Allison... it's obsessing me! <BR> Well I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
1377,Oh Stew and I went for a long ride.  Dexter is there any finishing school we can send him to? <BR> Yes - Sing Sing.
1378,You deserted me. <BR> You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you. <BR> You're the one who started running. <BR> Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
1379,Hello again neighbour. I didnt intrude did I? <BR> How are you Jane? <BR> Fine. How was the match? Did you loose? <BR> No. <BR> Must be your lucky day then. Ive got your accounts - you dont owe much tax for last year. <BR> Good. <BR> Yes. But my boss reckons youd still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that you know? Itd cost you about Ł100 but he said itd be worth it.  Of course youd need a partner to register. But thats a formality. I mean I could be your partner. I mean just as a name right?
1380, <BR> Well let's see now... If it has my name on it then I guess it's mine. <BR> Oh it sure has... You know you wrote your name in all my books 'cause you knew this day was gonna come. <BR> Well uh Alvy you wanted to break up just as much as I do. <BR> There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing without any doubt. <BR> Now look all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine. <BR>  <BR> Oh- <BR> This is the first book that I got you.
1381,It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it. <BR> He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business. <BR> Who? <BR> Twombley. <BR> No shit. <BR> You think Jack shot him? <BR> Well it was an accident. <BR> They were out deer hunting right? Jack probably heard the gun go off then came back and found the body.
1382,Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated. <BR> And the third one? <BR> You're the only one left alive...
1383,I wasn't expecting you. <BR> Wanted to wish you luck.  Not that you'll need it.
1384,Well she went somewhere! She didn't just up and disappear into thin air! <BR> No...not air --
1385,What were you doing when the voice came? <BR> Praying. <BR> The voice was in your cell? <BR> Yes. <BR> What did it tell you? <BR> Many things... <BR> Did it give you advice?  Good advice?
1386,Thanks but not for me. <BR> You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months? <BR> I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight and must be clear-headed for it. <BR> Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard eh? <BR> They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today. <BR> Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four? <BR> I heard your playing. <BR> I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness and I mope.
1387,You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand? <BR> You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch. <BR> Yes -- and for me it's going to leave at any minute. Let's drink.
1388,Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime? <BR> Fuck...
1389,You've got to be kidding. <BR> Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.
1390,5000 gold crowns. <BR> That's not a lot. <BR> It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families. <BR> I know... but the English want her very badly and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous. <BR> May I without offending you inquire how generous? <BR> 20000 gold crowns.
1391,Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger. <BR> You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd. <BR> I want that bastard dead! <BR> You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero. <BR> I am their hero! <BR> Not yet dear brother... <BR> Send them out!
1392,"So you believed the bartender. Why? <BR> Well... I think I saw her soul. <BR> That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her. <BR> I dunno that lady sounded pretty sure... <BR> No no Betty came here strictly for business 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So first thing we... <BR> Wait wait wait a minute... that doesn't make sense. <BR> What doesn't? <BR> You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory you believe that dumbshit trucker you believe this woman... <BR> I never said that I believed... <BR> No you believed her we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh? <BR> 'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how... <BR> I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca... <BR> You need to remember who you're talking to... <BR> I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me! <BR> Wesley... <BR> It's beneath her..."""" She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!"""
1393,You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God I'm an idiot. <BR> I do have a tendency to use that word too much. <BR> I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy. <BR> Thanks. <BR> And anyway you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal? <BR> Yeah. <BR> What's the goal Joel?  My goal Joel is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die because you stop listening to what is true and what is true is constantly changing. You know? <BR> Yeah. I think so. It's hard to -- <BR> Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist? <BR> Yeah. <BR> You're very nice. God I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me huh? <BR> No. <BR> I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat? <BR> No not at all. <BR> I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know if I don't love my body then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  So I've been seeing this guy...
1394,The question still remains: what do we do now? <BR> Gregor's cell phone...
1395,Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about? <BR> That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
1396,Get the kit! We're gonna tube him! <BR> Frank! <BR> Do it! <BR> Frank! <BR> We're gonna save you Noel. You're gonna be all right.  Do it Tom! I'll call for fucking backup I swear! <BR> You're crazy.
1397,I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City. <BR> Charlie Luciano. <BR> You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke. <BR> Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do. <BR> The goddamned bastards. <BR> Tell me about it.
1398,I caught one back there. <BR> Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
1399,By the time we return there all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed. <BR> Joseph returns from the room where Gisčle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it. <BR> The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc. <BR> Joseph is reading the diary which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown. <BR> The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp so that he can see Nikolas in bright light while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Léone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her but she is much too enfeebled to speak and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again. <BR> Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires]. <BR> The blood transfusion is completed. While Marc himself is looking after the patient the nurse leads Nikolas into an adjoining room where she makes him sit down and prepares his bandage. The doctor stands bending over Léone.
1400,More of Price's spook-house bullshit. <BR> Not at all!
1401,...stupid things. <BR> Watch it partner watch it! <BR> The worst was Blue.
1402,I gather weve done business with a friend of yours? <BR> Have you? <BR> The person who put us in touch seems to think so. <BR> I dont recollect mentioning a friend.
1403,I saw you on your bike today. <BR> With Mikey? <BR> Who? <BR> Nobody. <BR> Mikey Williams? <BR> We were just riding around.
1404,Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter? <BR> A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined. <BR> That's an evasion. <BR> She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every daywhether it's coming to her or not.
1405,What? <BR> Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
1406,Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home. <BR> Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
1407,D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them? <BR> I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die let it be this way.
1408,Hi Naomi it's Joel. <BR> Hi. <BR> How's it going? <BR> Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick. <BR> I know. I had to take the day to think. <BR> Yeah I tried you at home. Did you get my message? <BR> I just got in. <BR> Long day thinking.
1409,I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now! <BR> I can't let you do that either. <BR> Because you're afraid! <BR> No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
1410,Yeah sure. Look what happened to them. <BR> No no no I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy. <BR> My next delivery is up that way so I'll be getting down to it real soon.
1411,What are you doing? <BR> You'll beg for mercy in a second.
1412,So...how's the world of serious science? <BR> Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system? <BR> Whew. You never were much for small talk.  She still leave her clothes all over the floor?
1413,We just missed the turnoff to the party. <BR> You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
1414,No she did it. She killed the cheatin' wife too. <BR> Who gives a damn?
1415,'The Cuer-vo Gold the fi-ine Columbian.'  You look nice tonight. <BR> Thanks. So do you. <BR> Where do you feel like going? <BR> I don't know. Wherever you want. <BR> How about the point? <BR> The point sounds fine. <BR> All right the point it is.
1416,Stan I never cared for Gregory. <BR> You didn't? <BR> No dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear. <BR> Cool! <BR> <b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for-</b> <BR> <b>Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for</b>
1417,Mary... <BR> Yes? <BR> Order me a pastrami for after? <BR> Cole slaw ice tea? <BR> Thanks. <BR> Welcome Howard.
1418,That's us. <BR> I don't want to get up there. <BR> We've got to Brad everyone's watching.
1419,You guys got something going on downstairs? <BR> We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community. <BR> Basement bingo?
1420,Yes. <BR> ....going well.  How could I be so wrong.  SCO 1202 cross wired a 904.  He's been receiving extra credit.  He offered me some.
1421,So that's how we stand Baron. <BR> Look here sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight. <BR> Indeed you must Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm but you must go to jail Baron you're a thief. <BR> Be quiet. <BR> I'm going to call the police. I'm going to watch you play the great Baron with the police. Aristocrat! Aristocrat! 
1422,Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?! <BR> Can we -- uh -- discuss this later? <BR> Sooner is better than later!
1423,... never complain never explain John ... <BR> I tell you the soldiers were provoked.  Now stop this pussyfooting around.  Dead kids!  How the hell did we ever give the Democrats a weapon like this?  I mean if Cambodia doesn't work we'll bomb Hanoi if we have to.
1424,You're too kind. <BR> How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength? <BR> I know this sounds corny but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure I...  turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism but it works. <BR> That's beautiful.
1425,"You all right? <BR> A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate... <BR> No shark did that to a boat!"
1426,You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway. <BR> I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
1427,Whoa. Calm down. <BR> Get out. Get out! Get out! <BR> Take it easy! <BR> Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out! <BR> You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy. <BR> Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.
1428,What business is you in Homer? <BR> Mr. Rose I'm in the *doctor* business.  If you want I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.
1429,Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here! <BR> Thank you Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy? <BR> I couldn't make it in time. <BR> You mean you couldn't? Or you wouldn't? <BR> I don't know mon. The food lines took forever. <BR> Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this? <BR> I don't know.
1430,Leave him alone. <BR> He can't stay up there. <BR> He'll come down. Leave him alone. <BR> Yeah he's got to go to work hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that? <BR> No but he's looking after the money so what's the problem? <BR> Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
1431,Not here.  They might see it. <BR> If I'm going to die for the CIA I'm going to go out smoking.  Besides there's half a forest between us and them they can't see a goddamned thing.
1432,It's just that you know I was thinking about how in class you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. And don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great -- I mean really great -- but at times it's well very detailed you know with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and I don't know maybe I'm wrong but it sort of reads in places like well actually like...  ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if maybe when you wrote you weren't always... under the influence. <BR> Uh huh. Well thanks for the thought but as shocking as this may sound I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore it might interest you to know that one book I wrote as you say 'under the influence' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which by the way I accepted 'under the influence.'
1433,"We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing. <BR> What?  Win Vietnam, sir?"
1434,Sorry mates. Now there isn't even enough to go around... <BR> Don't worry man. It's all for you. <BR> No really mate? <BR> Here...
1435,Your father said you might be here. <BR> Two-all after six. <BR> I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column. <BR> We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us. <BR> I want to be fair-minded Nicky. <BR> All right. What's been going on? <BR> I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer. <BR> How prominent? <BR> He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut.
1436,Okay.  Here's what we're gonna do. <BR> I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...? <BR> Miss we are going to ask you to sign this little sheet of <u>paper</u>...
1437,I'm sick Tom. I need a cure.  Vitamin B cocktail followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer but all I got. <BR> Come on Frank. There's blood spilling in the streets.
1438,Thanks. That was good that crow sound. <BR> Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation? <BR> I don't know. <BR> Me neither. Oh there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued. <BR> Frost? <BR> Yeah. I'm not like a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know? <BR> It's pretty. <BR> I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway cheers! <BR> Cheers.
1439,Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me. <BR> It does huh?  Clark Kent I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
1440,So tell me about you and the Chancellor. <BR> What's to tell? <BR> Plenty I'm sure. But for what it's worth...
1441,You look a like you could use a friend.  You know I'll never forget my first day at camp. Boy I was so nervous that I... <BR> Hey--whaddya say we need another muskrat to join our Sunshine circle. Scurry up!  Isn't Fun great!
1442,And we both thank you for that but we're... we're... fine. <BR> I'm fine right. Fit as a fucking fiddle.
1443,--I don't know I don't know it feels thin-- <BR> --Christ I wish I knew if we should print this--
1444,Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work. <BR> I know.  You're right. <BR> People have problems insecurities flaws-- and you have to learn to compromise to overlook to forgive.  It's not settling Faith it's life.  Real life.
1445,The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia -- <BR> He didn't mess up. There it is ...
1446,You know we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously. <BR> ... Murderer... <BR> Bruce we're both murderers. Think how many people you've killed by letting me live.
1447,You just got crushed in a car. You're bleeding all over your self. And you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball as if at this very moment people weren't plotting your demise ... <BR>  <BR>  <BR> Hey now - <BR> He's gonna kill you -- ! <BR> I can handle it -- <BR> You can handle it? <BR> I can handle it -- <BR> You can handle it? <BR> I can handle it -- <BR> You? <BR> Me. <BR> You? <BR> Me...
1448,He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches. <BR> *Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
1449,Where are you staying while you're here? <BR> A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet. <BR> And how long are you here for? <BR> As long as it takes I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family? <BR> My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer. <BR> Oh. How old? <BR> About a year and a half. <BR> No your kids. <BR> Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16. <BR> Must be nice having kids.
1450,Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business but -- why did that detective come here last night? <BR> Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
1451,Length 22 feet 8 inches. <BR> Come on let's check the bite radius. <BR> The what? <BR> Bite radius.  You know the size of the mouth? <BR> The whale's mouth? <BR> The Shark's mouth. <BR> What shark?
1452,What? <BR> Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you? <BR> What are you talking about? <BR> The hatchery in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low far less than one percent that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation not the spotless little laboratory I showed you. <BR> I don't believe you. <BR> Isla Nublar was just a showroom Ian something for the tourists Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first on Isla Sorna eight-some miles from Nublar. <BR> No no no no no no . . . <BR> After the accident at the park a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling now I want you to go there and document them. <BR> Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares my reputation's a joke my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that? <BR> It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen. <BR> So what?
1453,Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks! <BR> You can't hold it by yourself! <BR> Ellie get the gun!  Try to reach the gun! <BR> I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
1454,'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is that correct? <BR> I. Yes. It is. <BR> And you wrote that... <BR> Yes. <BR> ...Page 414 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask? <BR> She threw up in her mask yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission. <BR> If she had eaten say one hour prior to admission the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...? <BR> Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case. <BR> Thank you.
1455,It's kind of a funny coincidence isn't it? <BR> Gotta come from somewhere... <BR> Where do you come from Marvosa?
1456,Why do you hunt them? <BR> Habit mostly just like this.
1457,How you know that? <BR> Remember who my brother is?
1458,Hello Bud I'm Lisa a friend of Gordon's. <BR> Lisa. Gordon? Oh Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you uh like to come in? <BR> Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed we're going out. <BR> We are?
1459,You sure you're okay -- ? <BR> Yeah man. Where is your beer?
1460,What's your problem? <BR> Why'd you jump? <BR> Because I felt like it.  What do you care? <BR> I couldn't do it. <BR> Well as soon as you grow some balls let me know.
1461,Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne. <BR> You know what he is talking about here?
1462,What is it? <BR> It's the rough-cut the other side's new commercial.
1463,You wrote this? <BR> It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time. <BR> Not yet. That's why I wanted to see you.
1464,Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police. <BR> Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?
1465,You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil? <BR> No. Don't bother.
1466,All I need is fifteen minutes a night. <BR> Fifteen minutes? <BR> Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married? <BR> What...?  0h yes. <BR> Not me. Ain't never loved anybody. Ain't never been married. Won't either.
1467,...Well I've got a large family. <BR> How many kids do you have? <BR> Uh I'm very proud to say that we have eight children. <BR> Eight children!  <BR> No no no no please please please please no please. <BR> That's amazing. <BR> There was nothing to it.  It was my pleasure.
1468,I think I've made my point with you tonight. <BR> Hey Mr. Hand can I ask you a question? <BR> What's that? <BR> Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff? <BR> Well you'll find out next year. <BR> No way mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building. <BR> If you graduate. <BR> You're gonna flunk me?!
1469,Tell us Jeanne... do you often hear this voice? <BR> Yes... <BR> Is it here?  Now?  In this room?
1470,Please don't move don't go anywhere. <BR> *Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night! <BR> If you're trying to be funny Homer... <BR> I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long enough then--with any luck-- I won't *ever* have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful after all...
1471,Jean Michel this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery. <BR> Yeah I met her already.
1472,You're helping Rajeev? <BR> No.  Rajeev's in India.
1473,I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke. <BR> Well stop listening to him.
1474,It does doesn't it? <BR> I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field.  At Meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the Gulf Stream.
1475,It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about. <BR> They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for.
1476,So you found Peter... <BR> I think we sort of found each other.
1477,That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago. <BR> I keep getting it for Christmas.
1478,You know this place will never be the same without you Ricky. <BR> Yes I know what you mean but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette. <BR> Is everything ready?
1479,Jesus you alright? <BR> Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I -- <BR> Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it! <BR> Sorry Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear -- <BR> -- never mind Eagle Bear. We've got Jimmy nailed. Let's go!
1480,The redistribution of wealth. <BR> What? <BR> Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for? <BR> The redistribution of wealth? <BR> That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed. <BR> I'm already in your bed. <BR> My cellmate would say she did her time for getting caught.  She was always more honest than me.
1481,You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them. <BR> I don't want them now. <BR> I'll not denounce you. <BR> I know. <BR> So -- <BR> Yesterday I was a thief -- but now -- <BR> But now you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go --- <BR> I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night at last I managed to came into your room and -- and now. <BR> And now? <BR> I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.
1482,You look so sad.  Is it something I have done? <BR> It is something I have done -- or did not do. <BR> What is that? <BR> I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
1483,I'm sorry Gallagher - really I am sorry. <BR> Oh that's all right Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned I'm just part of the hired help. <BR> No no. Strange I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl isn't it? <BR> Yes.
1484,Listen it's no big deal Pop. <BR> Come on smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
1485,Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again. <BR> Hah. <BR> Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder. <BR> When you've been in the system as long as I have you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
1486,If I was to think...If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over...I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just...Well I just... <BR> What is it? <BR> Well if you do think about names... Micheal's a pretty good one...It's done me all right.
1487,It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day Mademoiselle Monsieur. <BR> Good day.
1488,You do! You definitely do. <BR> Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday. <BR> I don't go there. Too many party girls. <BR> Party girls? Can I call you? <BR> Yeah if you have any dimes left. 477- 0496.
1489,Sure why not money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up baby it wasn't the upper east side. <BR> You're so naive Bud you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies in the stock market at the track. He was a lousy gambler... <BR> ...that changes all my plans I thought you were loaded... <BR> So did I till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do what makes you tick Buddy? <BR> Fear. The fear of being poor I guess just like you Darien... But that's all gonna change sweetheart. I'm catching the express...  ... and you're going along for the ride.
1490,I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it together.  When I was alone I knew. <BR> But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
1491,I take five hundred. <BR> All of that at once Baron?
1492,Are you really nineteen? <BR> Yes... I am really nineteen.
1493,Barney who is this bimbo? He a regular customer? <BR> Take it easy Jake. <BR> Look pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank. <BR> Jake for Christ's sake.
1494,When did it all start? <BR> You mean my problem? <BR>  <BR> I don't know. <BR> That's not a helpful answer. <BR> That's my answer.
1495,You're really gonna pop the question? <BR> Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that pińata we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts. <BR> I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing in public at a benefit. <BR> Yeah I was thinking...I mean I'm a celebrity now do I really want to get married? But on the other hand if you're married they can't testify against you.
1496,What?! <BR> Move slow and move quiet. <BR> No shit.
1497,They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in. <BR> No I can't.  I'm sorry and all but... <BR> Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone I'm threatening to blow the whistle. <BR> What whistle?  There's no fucking whistle.  This is fucking dangerous.
1498,In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven it's so unfair. <BR> Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly in a nice clean doorman building with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs. <BR> Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently. <BR> The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.
1499,Woody stop it!! <BR> Sorry guys but dinner's canceled!
1500,Mom I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little. <BR> Yeah so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or or-
1501,You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them... <BR> I'm a cop from New York. <BR> New York... <BR> They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
1502,Love! What the fuck do you know about love? <BR> Love! I'm made of love! <BR> Call it what you want. <BR> Everything you know is from me. <BR> Yeah. <BR> Bang! <BR> You and me.
1503,What are you doing. <BR> I got a bad feeling man. I don't want to go in naked. <BR> You gonna shank him in the shower? <BR> Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz who doesn't even want us here is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up -- <BR> We're getting ahead of ourselves. We haven't gotten any sleep. Let's just keep our mouthes shut and not make any mistakes. Now hurry up and get your shit on so we're not late and make things worse.
1504,Ya know they said no one listenin' in they'll be watchin' ya know. Maybe it's all bull but like you said Stan they're callin' the shots. <BR> Okay. And Scotty is he gonna be all right? <BR> Yah geez Scotty. I'll go talk to him.
1505,The family hired you and I have just fired you Mr Lombard. <BR> Why me Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son Mrs De Moraes? <BR> Huh! Who do you think we are Mr Lombard? <BR> Couldnt Nazi hunters do the job?
1506,No after you. <BR> You don't trust me? <BR> As far as you trust me.
1507,He's got a million dollar arm and a five cent head. <BR> --we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour 98 97 97. 97.   He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years. <BR> But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on y'know what I mean... <BR> You been around you're smart you're professional you know what it takes--  We want you to mature the kid.
1508,Oh thank you very much. <BR> Like you've got a grip. <BR> You're so out of it.  You've blown off cheerleading you've blown off dance committee --
1509,"You got it? <BR> Get behind me, dummy!  Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line!  Wet my reel, quick!"
1510,He'll be a minute hon. You want some coffee? <BR> No thank you. <BR> You sure? I just made it. <BR> No thank you. I'm good. Thanks.
1511,You haven't started in on the internal organs? <BR> Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
1512,You're not going to hit me? <BR> Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you. <BR> I knew you'd hit me.
1513,Where the hell do you come off hitting women? <BR> What are you talking about? <BR> Kathryn. Did you hit her? <BR> Kathryn? Oh Christ she got to you too? <BR> Did you hit her? <BR> Ronald you don't know what you're talking about. <BR> Don't know what I'm talking about? I know that you fucked Cecile.
1514,"I didn't say this wasn't the shark, I just said I wasn't sure this was the one... <BR> What d'ya mean? <BR> There are hundreds of different kinds of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads, white-tips... any one of them could've attacked. Look -- shark digestion is slow. We could open this one up, and find whatever he's been eating is still inside."
1515,Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman. <BR> How can you tell? <BR> The way they move they way they smell --
1516,Mr. Gittes? <BR> Yes? <BR> Do you know me? <BR> Well... I think I... I would've remembered. <BR> Have we ever met? <BR> Well no. <BR> Never? <BR> Never. <BR> That's what I thought. You see I'm Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray. You know Mr. Mulwray's wife.
1517,You ok? <BR> Just thinking about something. <BR> What? <BR> There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught. <BR> I guess so. Luckily we won't have that problem.
1518,Tell me Sam: why do you do this? <BR> Do what? <BR> Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up. <BR> It's my job. <BR> Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol Sam. <BR> Sure I do.  You heard him you heard the guy -- that's what he said what Edvard said. <BR> It's a cover then.  A cover within a cover a feint within a feint.  You work for the CIA it's the only possible answer.
1519,It's freezing out. <BR> You found us okay? <BR> Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink? <BR> We haven't checked. <BR> Well allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
1520,Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it. <BR> Maybe.
1521,It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant. <BR> Lucky it didn't step on his head.
1522,Come one that was so weird. <BR> What it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
1523,Is that me? <BR> That's you. <BR> I've never been supercargo.
1524,Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet? <BR> What do you mean your bracelet? It's our bracelet. <BR> All right. What happened to our bracelet? <BR> Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it. <BR> What did we do?  Joe you're not pulling one of your old tricks. <BR> No tricks no mirrors nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
1525,To help Jack of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus Rolfe whose side are you on? <BR> Take care of the little things first the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt get your car back call a dentist for God's sake and get your tooth pulled don't trust the locals get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
1526,No!  You take another step I'll shoot!  They're trying to kill me... <BR> You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
1527,Is this it? --  -- this is it right? -- <BR> -- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that -- <BR> -- don't sweat it I have a pen -- no problem -- just let me find the page --  -- honey why don't you wait for me outside okay? --
1528,I am the dark master! <BR> Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help Alan Dershwitz! <BR> SILENCE!  I AM SATAN! <BR> Oh. <BR> YOU HAVE SPILLED THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENTS. NOW THE WORLD BELONGS TO ME... NOW BEGINS TWO MILLION YEARS OF DARKNESS!!  AND ALL THANKS TO YOU!!!
1529,Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days. <BR> You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't. <BR> I might not be able to. <BR> It's not a prison it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
1530,This is pathetic. <BR> You're pathetic. <BR> What did you say? <BR> You're not a team player. <BR> Don't point at me. <BR> You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends. <BR> I have plenty of friends. <BR> The hell you do. <BR> The hell I don't. <BR> You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems. <BR> What are you fucking talking about?
1531,"He kept saying he was protected. <BR> What does that mean? <BR> Like if something happened to him, he could still get us. <BR> Like how? <BR> I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried. <BR> The only proof is those bodies. <BR> So what do we do? <BR> Move the bodies. <BR> Move the bodies?"
1532,Now then Otis. Did you get what I asked for? <BR> Yessir. Just what you wanted.
1533,It came up during the meeting. <BR> Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty.  It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right all along.
1534,Whoops! Yikes I didn't expect to see you up here. <BR> Sorry. I was just getting something. <BR> Did your wife send you up here to spy on me? <BR> What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something? <BR> Well you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto for all you know. <BR> I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out. <BR> I did steal a squirt of perfume. What do you think? It's Clinique Happy.
1535,Where's Leeloo? <BR> On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one. <BR> It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
1536,No I'm leavin' this mornin' back up to Brainerd. <BR> Well I'm sorry I won't see ya. <BR> Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's - <BR> What'd he say? <BR> Well it was nothin' specific he said it just seemd like it all hit him really hard his wife dyin' - <BR> His wife? <BR> Linda. <BR> No. <BR> Linda Cooksey? <BR> No. No. No. They weren't - he uh he was bothering Linda for about oh for a good year.  Really pestering her wouldn't leave her alone. <BR> So... they didn't... <BR> No. No. They never married.  Mike's had psychiatric problems. <BR> Oh. Oh my. <BR> Yah he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now. <BR> Oh. Geez. <BR> Yah Linda's fine. You should call her. <BR> Geez. Well - geez. That's a suprise.
1537,Oh it's you.  It's only Peter. <BR> Thanks. <BR> Sorry...
1538,Oh my poor baby. <BR> Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad. <BR> I know.
1539,We're going to get help. <BR> We gotta try. <BR> Anybody else?
1540,Yeah? <BR> I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing. <BR> That's a good one. <BR> I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
1541,Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today. <BR> You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels. <BR> No you don't. <BR> Okay but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
1542, <BR> I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow with say -- Miss Torso for a start?
1543,"I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people. <BR> Don't worry about it.  But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?"
1544,Moreau? Cest moi. Alors... <BR> Salut Laurent. Ouais. It wasnt easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say whats your business with these Spitzes? <BR> They lost their son. Why? <BR> It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as Never Forget. Over the years were talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings. <BR> Are they still operative? <BR> Their last suspected kill occurred two years back though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still Id watch my step. These people are well-connected Laurent; former Israeli prime minister etc. The ladys also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway you get the picture. <BR> Mossad? <BR> Its a good guess...
1545,Yeah. <BR> It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment. <BR> No shit? <BR> The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
1546,You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose. <BR> Yes - and I'd love it.
1547,Please -- please! <BR> You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
1548,So rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice. <BR> He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July. <BR> Really? Bulimic headcase. <BR> What a loser she must be.  Anyhow Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend. <BR> That's great. <BR> You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared. <BR> What are you scared of? <BR> Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do? <BR> Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends? <BR> Eww. No. That's gross. <BR> It's not gross. How else do you think girls learn? Here turn around and face me.
1549,"Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here? <BR> You're late, Eric."
1550,Hi Mom! <BR> Hello darling.  Good evening Mr. Carpenter.
1551,I'm sorry. <BR> Yeah me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years. <BR> That when you stopped being a nurse?
1552,What do you want it for Mr. Carpenter? <BR> Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you Bobby. Goodnight.
1553,Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need Miss Gallagher. <BR> Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye Mrs. Smith. <BR> Goodbye Miss Gallagher. <BR> Goodbye Stew
1554,Find them everywhere.  <BR> I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one. <BR> Which is? <BR> That it wasn't an accident. <BR> Then who shot him? <BR> Well your friend I think. Jack Hewitt. <BR> Motive. You gotta have a motive. <BR> Money. <BR> Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists. <BR> They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead? <BR> I don't know. You tell me. <BR> Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name Mel Gordon? <BR> Yeah the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did didn't I? <BR> Here's my theory. Twombley unaware of illegal union loans or whatever starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved. <BR> So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident. <BR> A hunting accident is perfect. <BR> Shit around here you shoot somebody in the woods you say it was an accident you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
1555,Who's running this trial you or her?  I can't believe it!  This wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that? <BR> She's loyal to her king... it's only to be expected that she...
1556,That girl you boned last year. Remember? <BR> Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
1557,David I don't... Can we talk privately for a second? <BR> Stop calling me David. We're on set for Christ's sake you don't have to call me David here.
1558,Good shit. <BR> Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other -- <BR> It's what? <BR> Don't fret Benjie it's -- <BR> Darn it Dave.
1559,Who is speaking? <BR> Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu. <BR> We don't trust you colonel. Come forward show yourself.
1560,No...She's not... <BR> I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
1561,Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio. <BR> Greer? <BR> I don't know. No. Not Greer. Somebody.
1562,It's better to split up to increase our chances. We must change hiding places and change them continually ... In the meantime we must make new contacts replace our arrested brothers reorganize our sections-- <BR> Yes but we must also show them that we still exist. <BR> Of course. As soon as possible. <BR> No immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ... <BR> No. Not you or any one of us. As long as we are free the NLF continues to exist in the Casbah. If they manage to take us too there won't be anything left ... And from nothing comes nothing ...
1563,"I questioned Joyce about all this... <BR> Yeah? <BR> Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift... <BR> ...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe... <BR> Junior year! <BR> Anyway, so what? <BR> So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them? <BR> You said a woman couldn't have done it. <BR> A woman can write a check. <BR> So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing. <BR> 'S just a theory... just 'cause I'm thinking it don't mean I like it."
1564,I don't mean to be nosy but I was wondering what happened to your arm. <BR>  <BR> And have you mended them? <BR> I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around I'll be in pretty good shape. <BR> You named the kid after yourself huh? <BR> That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
1565,She needs a family. A dad. I'll give her what you never had. <BR> Don't get my hopes up. If I quit what then? I can't go through this again.
1566,I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense. <BR> It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie you didn't see how he acted during the job we did.
1567,What the fuck are you talking about? <BR> That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
1568,That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time. <BR> Well we never have any laughs anymore is the problem. <BR> Well I've been moody and dissatisfied.
1569,Where do you live? <BR> Orange New Jersey. <BR> Got a couple of kids huh? <BR> Yeah. Just babies. <BR> You love them don't you? <BR> Oh gee Misteryou wouldn'tyou ain't thinkin' about <BR> You'll keep your trap shut all right. <BR> SuresureI'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me Mister. <BR> If you don'tEver hear of Bugs Dooley? <BR> No. <BR> Nice guy. Just like you. But he made a big mistake one day. Got kind of talkative. Know what happened? His kid was found in the bottom of the river. A rock tied around its neck. Poor Bugs! He couldn't take it. Blew his brains out.
1570,Now where the fuck is my money? <BR> Lick me. <BR> Where is it? <BR> Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.
1571,Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates I think.  <BR> Sam! Why call when we can go? <BR> And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?  Thanks.
1572,We... won?! <BR> Won?!  Such a small word will never do!  This is victory Jeanne this is... glory!
1573,What about bears? <BR> What about them? <BR> They could eat you. <BR> Yeah they could.
1574,I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday? <BR> Ahh... my wife's.
1575,And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leons Austrian was looking for you I reckon hed have found you before I did. <BR> Im sorry. Its just you dont look local... <BR> No sick people in the country huh?... Just tell me one thing Rhian. Leons story about the boy? You just took his word for it? <BR> Hed come prepared. He had something besides Shiva... Sleeping Beauty. The Disney film...  Well it looked like the Disney film. It was something else. I couldnt watch...
1576,You guys are playing music? <BR> Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
1577,Men? <BR> Oh you don't have to worry about that. <BR> We would be caught dead with men.  Those rough hairy beasts with eight hands -  They all want just one thing from a girl.
1578,I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance. <BR> There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund she's very beautiful yes but you were never interested in any woman. <BR> Well she isn't just any woman.
1579,Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here. <BR> Nobody knows.
1580,"Hi. Hi, hi. <BR> Hi. Oh, hi. Hi. <BR> Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door. <BR> You-you play... very well. <BR> "
1581,Come on. <BR> Wanna Mac? <BR> No I'd like the scarf. <BR> Have a Mac. <BR> I don't eat junk food. <BR> Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf anyway. What's your name? <BR> You're a fast mover. <BR> No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink.
1582,Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up? <BR> Because I'm in the middle of a boating accident I got only four regular cops and one secretary and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one. <BR> One what?  Ah-ha! <BR> Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating? <BR> It's an island.  Got to run.
1583,Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing? <BR> Learning about Cuba. Having some food. <BR> Mr. Spicoli you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time. <BR> I've been thinking about this Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
1584,I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee? <BR> No. I think I better just go. <BR> Okay. Thank you. <BR> Whatever.
1585,Frank this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl. <BR> He's not gonna stop Satch.  He's gonna keep on... <BR> Are you listening to me?  You're in a world of shit.  An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment.  We got your prints all over the place.  Plus the fucking driver's license Frank.  You gotta give me something here. Something I can believe.
1586,Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper. <BR> He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
1587,Maybe gay isn't the right word. But anyway it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level I want to break it off but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is I'm not getting any younger I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think no this is what I really want so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know? <BR> I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
1588,Now let's see ... Eton Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ... <BR> I know all this. <BR> Do you also know that during your final experiment your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance? <BR> Surveillance? By whom? <BR> Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling. <BR> Who's now vanished. <BR> Makes two of us. <BR> Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
1589,Rolfe. <BR> A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally turn off that TV!
1590,How much do you owe me Curly? <BR> Oh gee Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick. <BR> Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight. <BR> I don't know... <BR> I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred. <BR> Plus what I owe you? <BR> I'll throw that in too. <BR> Okay you got yourself a boat.
1591,Do you have it? <BR> Always in a rush you are.  All these years I've known you you could never wait for anything. <BR> This is important. <BR> Do you really think so? <BR> You know it is.
1592,Oh yes of course. How do you do? <BR> Gallagher this is Mrs. Smith.
1593,I didn't expect to see you again. <BR> Same here. But I had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon. You know to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture and he said it would be okay.
1594,"Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth... <BR> The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that?"
1595,In the kitchen under the sink. <BR> No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all unarmed.
1596,Show Mr. Van Orton to his room. <BR> The key? <BR> Hm? <BR> Is there a room key? <BR> Didn't I give you two? <BR> No you didn't...
1597,Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens you psyched for the Series? <BR> I don't really follow baseball anymore. <BR> What? <BR> I got fed up with all the bullshit. <BR> Fed up?  Lemme tell you something in a 1000 years when school kids study America they're gonna learn about three things: the Constitution Rock 'n' Roll and Baseball.
1598,Well I've been having a bad time of it with um my boyfriend I guess. <BR> You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him? <BR> What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
1599,Meyer. <BR> It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married. <BR> Married? To Anna?  You ain't got her in trouble? <BR> No. We ain't even... <BR> Well good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on. <BR> Guess I'm not a single type guy. <BR> Whatta ya mean? It's great!
1600,Right. Anyway I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission. <BR> Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
1601,Oh please do come.  Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun.  And bring your yacht. <BR> Come on Daphne.
1602,Do you really believe me? <BR> I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left all I wanted was...
1603,Well Mr. Green. <BR> Hi Sherry. <BR> How'd you get in here.
1604,Hello.. <BR> We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills... <BR> Call what call? <BR> It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing? <BR> That's right but I don't understand- <BR> We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight California time to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills... <BR> I placed...? <BR> Go ahead please...
1605,Well your condition's pretty serious. <BR> [Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What? <BR> I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable? <BR> Depends on what you're seeing.
1606,Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth. <BR> oh dear. <BR> What happened?!!! <BR> Ahm.... .
1607,All right knock it off. <BR> All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
1608,Strange to be calling yourself. <BR> Maybe it's not me. <BR> Call the number.
1609,It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties. <BR> Alright dad. But you sold the house you didn't tell anyone including the IRS and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff -- <BR> It was all junk!
1610,Captain the boy who is playing the piano somewhere I have seen him. <BR> Sam? <BR> Yes. <BR> He came from Paris with Rick. <BR> Rick? Who's he? <BR> Mademoiselle you are in Rick's and Rick is -- <BR> -- Is what? <BR> Well Mademoiselle he's the kind of a man that well if I were a woman and I...  were not around I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
1611,You found something? <BR> Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks. <BR> What? <BR> I'm not sure. A virus -- <BR> -- You saw this experiment? <BR> What did it look like?
1612,He killed her John.  He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it. <BR> It's not your fault Dad. <BR> Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse. <BR> No.
1613,"I thought we should celebrate. <BR> I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company. <BR> Ronald? <BR> Not that it's any of your business but yes."
1614,The opening's still too small we'll never get through! <BR> For chrissake give me a hand!
1615,Yeah... where are you taking her now? <BR> Back to Mexico. <BR> You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere. <BR> How about a plane? <BR> That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out leave everything. <BR> I have to go home and get my things. <BR> I'll take care of it. <BR> Where can we go? <BR> ...where does Kyo live? <BR> With us. <BR> On his day off. Get the exact address. <BR> Okay...
1616,Well now Miss Flaemm we can talk. <BR> Some champagne Miss Flaemm? <BR> You may go Mr. Kringelein. <BR> Does the world belong to you Mr. Preysing? <BR> What is this insolence? <BR> Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior but you're quite an ordinary man. <BR> Go away -- go away.
1617,It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it? <BR> Nope.
1618,No I'm not afraid. <BR> Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes? <BR> Yes...? <BR> Good. Now where did you get the hashish? <BR> A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar. <BR> Would you recognize him again? <BR> Yes.  I think so. <BR> Good.  Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him?
1619,What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin. <BR> Don't say that about my mom! <BR> I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall pressing his face into the tiles. <BR> Fuck you and fuck bowling. <BR> That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie. <BR> I don't need the stinking pro-tour. <BR> You're dead without the pro-tour and you know it. Get him away from me. Sid and Breeze punch Theo in the face.
1620,China. <BR> When's he coming back...? <BR> Touchdown Andrews fourteen hundred today. <BR> Alright now here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.
1621,Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford? <BR> Yeah lots. <BR> See. Get your boots. <BR> Hi honey.
1622,The Duke is to be addresses as... -- Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit checking seals and pulling on straps. <BR> Basically... <BR> Sire!
1623,It's going to take time Walter. <BR> Time. <BR> How do you feel about that? <BR> I feel... okay.
1624,But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse for a rainy day. <BR> What are you going to do now Tom? <BR> I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal otherwise -- <BR> Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day? <BR> What? <BR> I know it was you -- I know it was you Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you. <BR> Oh Marge.
1625,Try again. <BR> Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
1626,I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>? <BR> Honey you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket. <BR> Well what about <u>these</u>?  Do you usually put your <u>carbons</u> in your pocket too?!
1627,Hello? <BR> So I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me.
1628,I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful. <BR> I can tell you the year the day the night the minute. <BR> You used to love life. You don't exude this any more. <BR> What do I exude? <BR> Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread. <BR> Tonight you find out what it means to suffer. <BR> Tonight. What's tonight? <BR> Shit. They don't have any carrot soup. <BR> You mean because What's-His-Name. <BR> You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears. <BR> It's just a review. <BR> It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous. <BR> What's the fuss? I don't get it. <BR> That's what I said eighteen months ago. <BR> What happened eighteen months ago? <BR> Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers. <BR> And he was there? <BR> Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review. <BR> That's awful. <BR> I recite it to myself with masochistic relish. <BR> A year and a half later? You're still brooding?
1629,You on your way to trial too general?  Or do you think they've already had our trial? <BR> Why you? <BR> My loyalties... were in doubt. <BR> Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial. <BR> That's what worries me...
1630,I know I shouldn't have but there it was just sort of lying out and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck. <BR> No it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here has he? Poking around? <BR> I don't know -- maybe -- I don't think so.
1631,I know. <BR> He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him! <BR> Where's Mandalay? <BR> Burma! <BR> Oh... <BR> I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back! <BR> I understand.
1632,What about it? <BR> For Schumann. <BR> Well well well well wait a minute we got 86 percent.  We bring'em back <u>tomorrow</u> the charts go up they don't go <u>down</u>...
1633,I missed my therapy. I overslept. <BR> How can you possibly oversleep? <BR> The alarm clock. <BR> You know what a hostile gesture that is to me? <BR> I know- because of our sexual problem right? <BR> Hey you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
1634,But he's a policeman -- <BR> He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?
1635,...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass goddammit. <BR> Cheer up: before the night's through I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.
1636,My father's in a coma now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance. <BR> She should go home. <BR> I'd take her but then who would stay here?
1637,I don't care what they've done to you...what happened... <BR> They have done...nothing...They are my people...
1638,We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill! <BR> Not now Sven... <BR> I must KILL! Kill! <BR> It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
1639,How much do you need? <BR> Uh I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ... <BR> We could get that. <BR> Uh huh ... <BR> We could get a million dollars.  We could get it in cash.  I know where it could be gotten.
1640,I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  Want some more soup? <BR> No no it was great. <BR> How 'bout a back rub? <BR> No that's okay.  All I need's a little nap. <BR> I'll tuck you in. <BR> You can't seduce me. <BR> I'm not gonna try to seduce you sweetie...
1641,Is it nice? <BR> The Soho Grand? <BR> Yeah. <BR> You're from LA right? <BR> Yeah. <BR> You'll love it.
1642,Neski was a roadblock. Without me there's no company no fortune. You owe me Uri. One last push. <BR> One last push. One.
1643,Buffy!  Looking tasty. <BR> Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
1644,Madam has slept well? <BR> Oh yes Suzette. <BR> Madam will dress now it is late. <BR> Five minutes Suzette come back in five minutes. I'll ring. <BR> Yes madam Suzette knows all about it.
1645,Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you? <BR> I got your goddamn money you little punk. Now where's my daughter? <BR> I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase! <BR> Where's my daughter? <BR> Fuck you man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS - <BR> Where's my damn daughter? No Jean no money! <BR> Drop that fucking money! <BR> No Jean no money! <BR> Is this a fucking joke here?
1646,Don't shoot man don't shoot! <BR> What happened to Vivo?! What the hell happened to Vivo?
1647,It's me sir. <BR> What is happening?  Where's Mason?
1648,My brother's a priest man. <BR> No wonder you're such a chickenshit.  Now shut up.  There ain't no bat.
1649,What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived? <BR> I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting. <BR> Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter? <BR> He'll be there at 8:30. <BR> Tell me Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure? <BR> Yes sir -- it certainly does! <BR> That's good Hilda. I'm glad.
1650,What do you want? <BR> You're pretty when you're angry.
1651,We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right. <BR> It isn't right she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?
1652,The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious then he forgets you and it's very very cold. <BR> So I'm learning. <BR> He's not even aware of it. When you've got his attention you feel like you're the only person in the world. That's why everybody loves him. Other times...
1653,Tell me more about Cabot. <BR> He's a cool guy. A real nice real funny real cool guy.
1654,Like disposing of their wives? <BR> Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.
1655,Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today? <BR> Just you know shopping with my girlfriends.
1656,Calm down calm down. Shh! <BR> Shh.  Hide her car in the back!

1668,If somebody's aboard her already she ain't ours. She's theirs. <BR> Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours. <BR> Not in the eyes of the law.

1671,Where is this going Johnnie? <BR> Just admit it Caesar. <BR> Admit what? <BR> That you overreacted.  That you lost it.  Not me.  It was your mistake.
1672,That was a mistake Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary. <BR> Listen Bren-duhhh I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married. <BR> It doesn't work that way kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage. <BR> You don't know anything about me! <BR> I know enough.
1673,You got something better? <BR> If we move in a group we are one target. If we scatter they CAN'T get us all.
1674,Working nights? <BR> I'm a doctor. <BR> And he's a patient of yours? <BR> No. But he needs treatment. <BR> For what? <BR> A certain weakness. <BR> The human condition. <BR> You know about it? <BR> I write about it? <BR> And that's not the same thing? <BR> No but like all novelists I'm in search of the self.
1675,Dude we were practically made... <BR> I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in? <BR> No. I'll wait here. <BR> I'll be a minute.
1676,It's a terrible shock eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday? <BR> I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car. <BR> So Signor Miles drove away and you did what? <BR> I went to bed. Freddie's a big man but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him?
1677,Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence. <BR> I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going? <BR> We have our new army.  Dr. Yueh put the weirding module on him.
1678,I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone. <BR> Did they ask you a lot of questions?
1679,We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role. <BR> Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
1680,"Wizard! <BR> I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you. <BR> Mine too. <BR> Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend. <BR> Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil. <BR> That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude. <BR> Can we make out now? <BR> Okay."
1681,This is going to stop right now. Right now! <BR> You will not screw this up.
1682,What's your fucking point? <BR> I'm not talking to you?
1683,Frankie! Frankie you piece of shit! <BR> Fuck you you motherfuck!
1684,You're absolutely right I wouldn't give her another thought. <BR> You know you're okay Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job but you're okay. <BR> Thanks Curly. Call me Jake. <BR> Thanks. You know something Jake? <BR> What's that Curly? <BR> I think I'll kill her.
1685,We'll pretend it never happened. <BR> So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate? <BR> I don't hate you. <BR> Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money. <BR> And? What are you saying? <BR> And. It's wrong. <BR> And who says what is wrong. <BR> And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency. <BR> What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly. <BR> So. What then? You just detach sex from everything.. <BR>  <BR> Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.
1686,I'm not gonna let that happen. <BR> You still don't believe me do you? <BR> I do believe you... <BR> No. Listen to me...the kid Eugene...
1687,What's wrong with it -- ? <BR> Needs brightening ...
1688,Jesus Christ! <BR> Just a deer Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife. <BR> Get rid of them.
1689,Where do you think you're going?! <BR> To collect my fee.
1690,Good afternoon Mrs...? <BR> Spitz. We spoke on the telephone.  My husband...  My daughter Deborah whose house this is.  My son-in-law Carlos...  The gentleman is a business partner of his. 
1691,...sorry Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you. <BR> You didn't do it to me Will; it's happened to us.  And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay...  He's after you now isn't he?
1692,Where you going? <BR> C'mon Tom. The city's burning.
1693,Hey!  I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip!  We go through the wall. <BR> We go through the wall?
1694,Christ Ruby it's been so long. I figured you were dead. <BR> Eighteen and a half years. <BR> Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred. <BR> You're looking good Auggie. <BR> No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin? <BR> I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed Auggie and it never gave me nothing but grief. <BR> And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook? <BR> You always were a son-of-a-bitch weren't you? A little weasel with a quick dirty mouth. <BR> At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people. <BR> I've got something to talk to you about and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you and I'm not going until you've heard me out. <BR> Talk away lady of my dreams. I'm all ears. <BR> This is private Auggie. Just between you and I. <BR> You heard her pipsqueak. The lady and I have private business to discuss. Go outside and stand in front of the door. If anyone tries to come in tell 'em we're closed. You got that?
1695,Is this what you wanted? <BR> You could've killed him you know. You could've killed the Joker. <BR> I had to save you Vicki. I --  -- Please trust me.

1697,Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes. <BR> Ropes?
1698,Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler I don't want to... <BR> Sir Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is...
1699,Get to work. <BR> What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds? <BR> Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame. <BR> And this is what you rented? <BR> I like to expand my horizons. <BR> I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor. <BR> No way! <BR> Five hundred dollars. <BR> You're bullshitting.
1700,Mrs. Mulwray I'm afraid that's not good enough. <BR> Well how much would you like? <BR> Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story. <BR> I have? <BR> I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset. <BR> Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
1701,I'll leave this afternoon. Happy? <BR> It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
1702,Coming up!  Give way! <BR> Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
1703,Alright well alright:  geopolitically... <BR> We've just found out They Have the Bomb.  We've Just Found Out They Have The <u>Bomb</u> aaaand...

Ooookay.  It's a <u>suitcase</u> bomb and it's .... in Canada!  Eh?  Albanian Terrorists have placed a suitcase Bomb in Canada in an attempt to infiltrate the bomb into the USA. <BR> You know what?  This is good.  This is terrific and I'll tell you why:  it's <u>cost effective</u>.  This is.... <BR> It's <u>producing</u>. <BR> No this is great. <BR> I could tell you stories:  Cecil B. Demille:  Alright? The Greatest Show on Earth:  He needs an elephant
1704,Don't worry I'll take care or it <BR> You're so good.
1705,So did you sleep good? <BR> Yeah... I have to go to town.
1706,Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down! <BR> So you wanna git bit huh? <BR> Cut the bullshit we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit both of you got ten years on me and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two always fightin' always sayin' they're gonna kill one another. <BR> You said yourself you thought about takin' him out. <BR> Then. That time has passed. Right now Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops. <BR> You takin' his side? <BR> Fuck sides! What we need is a little solidarity here. Somebody's stickin' a red hot poker up our asses and we gotta find out whose hand's on the handle. Now I know I'm no piece of shit...  And I'm pretty sure you're a good boy...  And I'm fuckin positive you're on the level. So let's figure out who's the bad guy.
1707,Ellie we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply they're totally wrong!  This is a warm-blooded creature.  They're totally wrong. <BR> They were wrong.  Case closed.  This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake!

I've had my head up my ass the entire time. <BR> Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about. <BR> That I should've picked you up? <BR> 
1711,I don't believe a thing she just said. <BR> Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about Eugene? <BR> I have no idea. <BR> You think Lorenson kills you? <BR> Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does but at the very least she knows how I died. <BR> Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with. <BR> Why? <BR> Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
1712,Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider. <BR> And I thought at last she's here she wants me. <BR> I don't want you Steven.
1713,Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan Joe Namath JFK Paton Lombardi Hemingway... <BR> Franco mother-fucking Harris!

1716,D'you find an apartment? <BR> Still looking. <BR> I changed my life today. What did you do? <BR> I changed my room at the Hotel. <BR> Why? <BR> The TV didn't work. <BR> What Hotel are you staying at? <BR> And what are you? A cop? <BR> I'm a lawyer. <BR> My ex-husband was a lawyer. <BR> Really. How wonderful for you. <BR> Yes. It was actually. <BR> Oh actually it was. Then why'd you call it off? <BR> Who says I'm the one that called it off? <BR> A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name? <BR> Laura. <BR> My name's Frank. And furthermore you came back to see me tonight. <BR> What if it wasn't you that I came back to see? <BR> You just got lucky.  D'you eat yet? Come on.
1717,"It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children- <BR> Gable. Why a feller like that don't come East to do a play..."
1718,Tina it's Dawnie. I'm  on my way. Cici follows her back into the living room. <BR> I'll go. I don't mind. Really.
1719,So what are you going to do? <BR> Do? <BR> I just mean I -- I guess Emily isn't going to be there when you get home.
1720,So your husband ditched you? <BR> No no no it was... it was wild out there no time to think we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran. <BR> Well justice is funny.
1721,Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it. <BR> Be like a weight off your shoulders. <BR> You know we're right. <BR> Don't you?
1722,Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort? <BR> Katrina? Pfft no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date. <BR> He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana then the prom then to Vijay's parents' cabin. <BR> Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup! <BR> Oh it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know boys have endured worse things for nookie. <BR> There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands. <BR> I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now. <BR> Yeah well Bleek trusted me. We're best friends. <BR> Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did. <BR> I'm not jealous and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all. <BR> Okay Juno I'm really convinced. <BR> Prom is for wenises anyway. Once you're old enough to go it's not cool anymore.
1723,The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The one's who made the arrangement... who were they? Maybe I can talk to them. <BR> Miles. Three other suits. That's all I know 'em as -- suits. Were you there? <BR> You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over man cuz his spirit is out. It's out and it knows. <BR> What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn. <BR> Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?! <BR> I took him out before he got the chance. He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in the dirt. Forever. <BR> What's Tashka Sha speak English speak English! <BR> Red Deer Table! What's with you man?
1724,That little place just two hours form New York. It's on my list of things-I'll-never-understand. Like collecting shrunken Indian heads... <BR> Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet- <BR> Peace and quit is for libraries.
1725,Just Erich. <BR> I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.
1726,She's got guards with her. <BR> What guy? <BR> Randy somebody.
1727,It's only one night Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for? <BR> Who?
1728,"I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now. <BR> How's that? <BR> You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol. <BR> What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome."

1733,Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time. <BR> We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it work our the code and put ours in next week. <BR> Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper? <BR> Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says. <BR> And if we pull it we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon. <BR> It's your call Will. What do we do?

TH-- <i></i> Something went very very wrong here. <BR> Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.

1747,Oh jeez Benjie. Well here you are. <BR> Damn right but where the hell were you? <BR> What are you talking about? <BR> Don't bullshit me around Janey. Jesus Christ I waited around for more than half an hour in nothing but my boxer shorts and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?
1748,Tony and I have to talk some business first. <BR> I gotta try and overcharge him he has to moan about the price we settle somewhere in the middle. <BR> It's a matter of respect.  Why don't you wait outside this won't take long.

1754,Oh God. This is insane. <BR> What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
1755,"Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully. <BR> About what? <BR> -- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building. <BR> She was with me."
1756,"Excuse me colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture then one should call it torture. <BR> I understand. What's your question? <BR> The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers that's all ... <BR> Let's try to be precise then. The word torture"""" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF they request that their members in the event of capture should maintain silence for twenty-four hours and then they may talk. Thus the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?"" <BR> The law is often inconvenient, colonel ... <BR> "
1757,I feel so bad for her. I mean she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty. <BR> That's because men are big fat retards who don't -- Oh my God...
1758,I'm still not confident we can ride through this.  Some people are going to have to go to jail.  Hunt's not the only problem.  Haldeman let me use the $350000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments.  Ehrlichman had a role a big role in the Ellsberg break-in. And I'm ... uh I think it's time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses. <BR> You say John cut our losses and all the rest.  But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus you'd never recover from that John.  It's better to fight it out instead and not let people testify ... <BR> Sir I still don't think uh we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ... <BR> Jesus everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous? <BR> I agree it's ridiculous but -- <BR> 
1759,I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital I'm not kidding. <BR> Very big. <BR> I opened thousands of brains. <BR> What did you find? <BR> Big mess every time. <BR> I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds.
1760,Tell me where we're going. <BR> Just drive man.  It's fucking nuts! <BR> What's this all about Connie? <BR> Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
1761,We think he's had a change of heart.  So we should be celebrating. <BR> I hope so. <BR> That was moving wasn't it? When Meredith said --  Meredith's the American girl I saw last night I know her at the Opera she's been seeing something of Dickie --
1762,It's not my voice ... but I know her. <BR> Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are. <BR> Maybe...maybe ... maybe.
1763,Buddy buddy buddy; little trouble huh today. <BR> Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man American Express got a hit man looking for me. <BR> Hey things could be worse. It could've been my money. Let me help you out rookie.
1764,You want a Dairy Queen? <BR> No way. I'm about to blow up.
1765,Powell?  What's going on? <BR> Ask the FBI.  They've got the terrorist playbook and they're running it step by step.
1766,You can have both if you want. <BR> No you keep one.
1767,Alone again.  What are you up to today? <BR> I'm doing some volunteer work. <BR> Need any company? <BR> You? Volunteer? I don't think so. <BR> I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive. <BR> Okay. <BR> Babe you're looking at the next Mother Teresa.
1768,You want to tell me what I'm looking for? <BR> I've only been invited to her house once but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research. <BR> Okay.
1769,"I won't waste your time and Catherine's time bargaining for petty privileges. Clarice Starling and that awful Jack Crawford have wasted far too much already. I only pray they haven't doomed the poor girl... Let me help you now, and I'll trust you when it's all over. <BR> You have my word. Paul?"
1770,Oh you are such a maroon! <BR> You would know dummy.
1771,Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro. <BR> Her old boyfriend? <BR> No she killed her boyfriend. Randy was a friend. MICKEY Watch out Derek.
1772, <BR> Yes I do... <BR> Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again. <BR> What a nasty thing to say. <BR> He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that. <BR> Oh...  Crash is a very smart man.  Now c'mon honey give it a try.
1773,Is it real?  You people are sick. <BR> Huh. Id have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there friend. They make up the clientčle. Get rid of them and were out of business. <BR> Only feeding the disease eh Martin? <BR> Money talks bullshit walks whether you like it or not. <BR> Maybe I dont. <BR> Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines. <BR> Im overcome by your public-spiritedness. <BR> Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where theyre not wanted improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
1774,So Caesar what did it total out at? <BR> Two point one seventy-six.
1775,Alex. <BR> What? What's wrong? <BR> What are you doing? <BR> I'm just looking. <BR> Don't. <BR> Don't look? <BR> No. <BR> Why not? What's wrong Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from? <BR> No.The guy's dead.What more do you need? <BR> It's not every day I find a story in my own flat. <BR> Thats not a story Alex. It's a corpse. <BR> Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational please and failing that be quiet.
1776,Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me! <BR> I'm heading in to work baby. Are you sure you'll be okay? <BR>  <BR> They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times. <BR> I need a new PR guy.
1777,Calm down my lord I beg you! <BR> How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough! <BR> Be patient my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress... <BR> So long as this bitch remains alive our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
1778,Dumont! <BR> No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first... <BR> Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn? <BR> They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
1779,I didn't do too well for you. <BR> No you did fine. <BR> I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday? <BR> No. No thank you Doctor. You go home. <BR> You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth. <BR> Yes... I... yes.
1780,He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad... <BR> What kind of job... ? <BR> A boost. A big boost ... <BR> A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
1781,No no? You didn't? <BR> I didn't give 'em the m- <BR> Don't fuck with me Al! Don't make a fuck out of me! You want to embarrass me and make a fool out of me?!  You didn't gamble?! Tell me you gambled the fuckin' money I'll give you the fuckin' money to put the fuckin' heat on! Did you gamble?! Huh?!
1782,Notice the grain. See how deep and rich the red runs? <BR> Yeah. It's really nice.
1783,He's going back. <BR> Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore. <BR> It's Paris.  The route's too indirect for anything else.  A guy like Gregor he doesn't waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place. Otherwise he'd be out of the country by now.  He's going to Paris.  Now I just hope we can find him before he gets there.
1784,So what's in a name?  I wanna join him.  I don't see why we can't join him. <BR> I told you.  If he sees me here with another guy he's gonna think I'm here with another guy.  I just don't want to send any confusing signals.
1785,Betrothed?  I think not. <BR> In his mind anyway and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love.
1786,Kill kill kill kill hah hah hah hah... <BR> Stop it... <BR> I can't believe you're alone in that house.
1787,Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...? <BR> Fuck...  I forgot about that.
1788,This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king! <BR> If the young woman truly loves Raoul -- <BR> She's a woman d'Artagnan!  From a poor family.  You may still be young enough to believe love conquers everything but I am old and hard and I've seen too much.  Even when kings are hunchbacks they have any woman they desire because power seduces even more than love!
1789,Hello. <BR> Mrs. Doyle? <BR> Yes. <BR> Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet? <BR> Not yet Jeff. <BR> You haven't even heard from him? <BR> Not a word.
1790,So we're stupid now? <BR> You know just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year. <BR> Except for Prom. <BR> Right.
1791,Everyone aboard young Bill? <BR> Yes Sir. <BR> Good.  Let's go sailing.
1792, <BR> Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
1793,On a hunger strike huh?  When'd she eat last? <BR> She hasn't had a thing yesterdayor today. <BR> Been sending her meals in regularly? <BR> Yessir. She refuses them all. <BR> Why didn't you jam it down her throat? <BR> It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time but this one <BR> Absurd!  All this fuss over a snip of a girl.  I'm going down to see her myself.
1794,How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking? <BR> Cuz dummy they're Canadian just like Ike! <BR> Oh.
1795,Is that too much Baron? <BR> No -- not at all. <BR> All right then. <BR> All right then.
1796,You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch didn't you? <BR> What? <BR> On the cervix transfer you almost lost the T297.
1797,Hey listen listen. <BR> What? <BR> Gimme a kiss. <BR> Really? <BR> Yeah why not because we're just gonna go home later right? <BR> Yeah. <BR> And-and uh there's gonna be all that tension. You know we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay? <BR> Oh all right. <BR> And we'll digest our food better. <BR> Okay. <BR> Okay? <BR> Yeah.
1798,Yeah. Sure. <BR> How 'bout this. If you're in he's in. <BR> I gotta tell you Mr. Reuben I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess... <BR> You're ready to move up. Christ the way you busted up the place you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished. <BR> It's not that I don't appreciate the offer... <BR> Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask? <BR> No. Okay. I'll think about it.
1799,I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South. <BR> She's going to rest now. <BR> Okay I just wanted to see if I could help out at all.
1800,You're a smart boy Charlie but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. A man needs a family. <BR> I know. When the storm hits it don't pay to be caught outside. <BR> I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery. <BR> Never threaten me Boss.
1801,So she's pretty cool huh? <BR> Actually no she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory but she got shot and arrested. <BR> No shit? <BR> Yeah she's a total loser.  C'mon let's check out the 7-Eleven whatya say?
1802,Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut Utah? <BR> Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
1803,Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you.  Proof! <BR> Martin this is kind of an official meeting <BR> Perfect.  Look at this ---
1804,"...can we see the Kitten...? <BR> <u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...? <BR> We'll be back tonight. <BR> Tonight.  Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot. <BR> Waal, that's where you <u>want</u> em... <BR> ...I just hope..."
1805,Good move. <BR> Yeah they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
1806,-- let's check that Interpol window again -- <BR> -- I'm on it -- <BR> -- I want that red car -- the girl -- we gotta get lucky here --
1807,A movie *outside*? <BR> Yes. But it's closed all the time now because of the blackout. <BR> People watched the movies in their cars? <BR> When they watched at all. Do you like movies? <BR> Yes! I've only seen one though.
1808,Who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived. <BR> Well Michael Bolton's pretty grisly. <BR> I vote for Bart.
1809,You ever talk to a victim's family?  The one's left behind?  They don't act like what you'd think.  There's panic and fear.  But mostly it's like there's this logic problem.  And if they could only solve it everything would be okay.  But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  Just a glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They know their world is never gonna be the same. <BR> What if the radio stops working?  Christ what if I can't reach you again? <BR> Then you get Mom the hell out.  But Dad those other women weren't supposed to die.  We don't try to stop this guy we're gonna live with that for the rest of our lives.
1810,You pickin' nothin' but cider apples Peaches--I hope you understand that. <BR> They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree! <BR> Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they ain't no better than drops to me. See that bruise and that one? *Half* of these is bruised! Look at this one! It ain't got no stem! You might as well *step* on 'em too--they only good for cider.
1811,Well it looks like we both lucked out.  I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to. <BR> Oh.  That's nice. <BR> Yeah.
1812,No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing. <BR> You think I got any kind of a voice?
1813,Here and there. Around. <BR> Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places probably. <BR> Yeah that's right. <BR> Except that there's no bed is there? And no breakfast either. <BR> The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head. <BR> But your body is in the world isn't it?  If someone offered you a place to stay you wouldn't necessarily refuse would you? <BR> People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York. <BR>  <BR> Thanks but I'll manage. <BR> In case you're wondering I like women not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights. <BR> I can take care of myself. Don't worry. <BR> Suit yourself. But if you change your mind here's the address. 
1814,Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning. <BR> Yeah.
1815,Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go! <BR> Forget it pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
1816,You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final. <BR> Yeah luckily.
1817,It's awfully hot--  --and you haven't finished telling me about the money-- <BR> --omigod there was so much of it six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal I guess I did til after the break-in when I remembered Gordon got so much of it. <BR> Gordon Liddy you mean? <BR> It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it. <BR> Think Sloan's being set up as a fall guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it looks that way.
1818,She's gettin' prettier Ma. <BR> Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
1819,It's something I had to do. For David. <BR> 'David.' That's your guy. So you staying with him?
1820,Alright now tell me. What is it? <BR> There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe. <BR> You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps. <BR> Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan? <BR> It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan I guess. <BR> Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later. <BR> Now how are you going to do that? <BR> Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window. <BR> What will I say when she comes to the door? <BR>  <BR> I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous. <BR> Let's just try the first part. If that goes well we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this. <BR> You've got a point there.
1821,This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it? <BR> Ballistic penetration shocks it but only for a few seconds.
1822,Miss Flaemm. <BR> Hello! <BR> I must speak with you Miss Flaemm. <BR> Presently Mr. Preysing. <BR> It's urgent.
1823,Oh yes you will my dear - oh yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too! <BR> Oh no I won't my dear - oh no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears but no I won't my dear!
1824,Yeah -- ? <BR> Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on
1825,I'm showing summer rentals.  We got a helluva season going. <BR> We have got to talk and we have got to talk alone. <BR> We're alone. <BR> Larry I don't know how to say this but I think we got a shark problem. A real one.
1826,Nice Guy. When we got to the bar... <BR> ...What bar? <BR> The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange. <BR> You ever seen this motherfucker before? <BR> Who Mr. White? <BR> Yeah. <BR> No he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well. <BR> How can you tell? <BR> The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies. <BR> Did the two of you talk? <BR> Me and Mr. White? <BR> Yeah. <BR> A little. <BR> What about? <BR> The Brewers. <BR> The Milwaukee Brewers? <BR> Yeah. They had just won the night before and he made a killing off 'em. <BR> Well if this crook's a Brewers fan his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery and put a name to that face.
1827,Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar? <BR> You heard his Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
1828,What took you so long? <BR> I just walked in. <BR> Hmmm. Do you miss me? <BR> Oddly enough I do. <BR> Ha Ha! You said I do. I guess that means we're married. <BR> I guess so. <BR> Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
1829,...The thousand dollars of course was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way... <BR> You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever. <BR> I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers... <BR> I can't how can I in all decency? We've had a good run haven't we? <BR> What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least? <BR> I don't think so Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great though if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?
1830,But what am I telling the press about Kent State? <BR> Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
1831,Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him you can get something really big something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap wouldn't it? <BR> It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful. <BR> Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.
1832,You're losing it Damone. <BR> You're crazy. Those girls love me.
1833,They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much went for a swim and drowned. <BR> Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight. <BR> The staff dont know yet...  I called my parents told them everything...  I just couldnt take any more... <BR> Get to the point will you... <BR> My parents flew back from Israel... Told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to Brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce. He flew back to Brazil...  And his drowning was arranged...
1834,Excuse me Monsieur Rick but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money. <BR> Well I'll get it from the safe. <BR> I am so upset Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand -- <BR> -- Forget it Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time. <BR> I'm awfully sorry.
1835,You sound...ground up...? <BR> I'm thirty-five years old. <BR> Thirty-five?  That would make it... <BR> 1998.
1836,I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy! <BR> Yeah how do I know? <BR> You can't make me stop caring... <BR> What? What?! <BR> I said you can't make me stop caring about people.
1837,Really? <BR> I was talking to the priest and do you know what he said to me?
1838,Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him. <BR> Even though he knew about you? <BR> Yes. <BR> He was in love with you right? <BR> That's what he told himself.  But it wasn't even about me it was about Caesar.  He wanted what Caesar had. That's how they are.  I understand them.
1839,What do you need money for? <BR> To bail Lisa out of jail.
1840,So what do you think we should do? <BR> I thought I might you know nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant. <BR> Yeah typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant. <BR> So that's cool with you then? <BR> Yeah wizard I guess. I mean do what you think is right. <BR> I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea. <BR> Whose idea was it? <BR> I'll see you at school O.K.?
1841,I don't know what he did to her but she got even. <BR> Was he all pissed off?
1842,I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment Darcy was like a vision of perfection. <BR> I know what you mean. <BR> At that moment at that block party she represented everything holy about a virgin. <BR> She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them. <BR> I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her. <BR> How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law. <BR> I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me. <BR> Bet.
1843,Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say. <BR> The Tooth...
1844,I'm going to take you to Margo... <BR> Oh no... <BR> She's got to meet you- <BR> No I'd be imposing on her I'd be just another tongue-tied gushing fan...
1845,How are you today? <BR> Okay I guess. <BR> Well why don't you tell me what's going on? Do you mind if I turn this on?
1846,Ain't you gonna look back Ma?--give the ol' place a last look? <BR> We're goin' to California ain't we? Awright then let's *go* to California. <BR> That don't sound like you Ma. You never was like that before. <BR> I never had my house pushed over before. I never had my fambly stuck out on the road. I never had to lose... ever'thing I had in life.
1847,That her? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Jesus she reeks of Laura Ashley.  Oh she's crying. Wittle baby's upset by the big bad book.
1848,Excuse me. Excuse me! <BR> You talking to me? <BR> Look I know this is your house and all but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read. <BR> What'cha reading? <BR> The Fountainhead. <BR> Great book. <BR> You've read The Fountainhead? <BR> Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature. <BR> Romantic? He rapes her. <BR> That's a matter of opinion. <BR> You need help. <BR> Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it. <BR> At this hour? I don't think so. <BR> Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool. <BR> Gee with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse. <BR> Please. <BR> Give me a minute. I'll be right down. <BR> Thank you.
1849,You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT! <BR> We can't risk letting them in. <BR> Right.
1850,It's not so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff. <BR> But James. I mean... How long? <BR> A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection. <BR> Jesus James you should've told someone. <BR> Who? <BR> I don't know...  Me.
1851,You want us to fire a shot if... <BR> No...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side.
1852,You can talk while I drive us to the police. <BR> No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in but you won't be able to prove anything else.
1853,Can I help you look for the space man? Can I?  I know what he looks like! He's got a square head -- and three great big eyes! <BR> That's enough Bobby. I think it's time you went to bed.
1854,Hurry! <BR> REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!
1855,Who told you that? <BR> My dad. <BR> It works? <BR> Swear to God.  Only good advice he ever gave me.  Now go back to sleep.
1856,Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can. <BR> Tomorrow? <BR> As soon as I can. <BR> On your honor as a Roman officer daddy? <BR> On my honor as your daddy...
1857,You'll be designing monuments soon Albert! Hotels! Palaces! <BR> Bunkers! <BR> I take the man out of Argentina - and it was no picnic finding him y'know? And what does he think about? Bunkers. Still living in the past when I am about to realize the greatest real estate scheme in the history of the world!
1858,They're playing your song Mrs. Peel. <BR> 'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
1859,I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it. <BR> How do you know? <BR> I just know. I know you'll love it. <BR> But I'm scared Telly. <BR> I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about. <BR> Nothing?
1860,C'mon guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this. <BR> But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. <BR> Hey listen no one's getting replaced.  This is Andy we're talking about.
1861,Is that the best quality you have? <BR> Yeah it's the best one. <BR> I'll take the whole tin. <BR> It's three thousand dollars! <BR> I'll take it.  Andy gimme three thousand dollars.  Just the caviar  I'll get the rest.
1862,Oh hello Anne He types furiously. <BR> Good morning. What does this mean?
1863,What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd? <BR> You're the Tribune man? <BR> Yeah hello. How are you?
1864,That was good. <BR> He heard everything we were saying.
1865,Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse... <BR> I don't understand.
1866,What'd you dream about? <BR> Nothing. <BR> Come on what was it? <BR> Nothing.  It was just a dream.
1867,What fire and music? <BR> You wouldn't understand.  How was Miss Caswell?
1868,This is an extremely dangerous direction Mr. President.  Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement. <BR> But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century. <BR> By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize? <BR> Cuba would be a small price to pay. <BR> So President Kennedy thought.

1873,I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream. <BR> Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall. <BR> I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes knowing in their hearts I wasn't human. <BR> If you're not human then why do you bleed like us?

What happened to your latest boyfriend? <BR> Oh... We split up. <BR> Well I hope youre not too heartbroken and... <BR> Oh no. Im all right. He was a jerk really. Another boy you know?

1918,"It's the President's personal property!  I will never give up my tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving Harvard Democrat cocksuckers! <BR> This could trigger the impeachment.

I'm not giving 'em my tapes! <BR> Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena? <BR> Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ... <BR> Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir. <BR> For what?!"

So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother. <BR> M'm. <BR> And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that? <BR> Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that so so... you know. <BR> M'hm. <BR> G-go on I'm interested. <BR> Well she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage and-and children. <BR> M'hm. <BR> And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love. <BR> Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour? <BR> M'hm. <BR> That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years I-you know I don't got... nothing like that in- <BR> Oh I told her my dream and then I cried. <BR> You cried? I've never once cried.

Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice. <BR> Tsch what'd the doctor say? <BR> Well she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is will it change my wife? <BR> Will it change your wife? <BR> Will it change my life? <BR> Yeah, but you said, Will it change my wife""""!"" <BR>  <BR>  <BR> "
1921,Hans he killed by brother -- <BR> Karl I know you want him but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!

She's gonna piss it all away in about a year and then where will she be?  Where would you be then? Comin' right back to me right back to me.  Or finding some other excuse to come and I - I - <BR> We had a deal. Remember that?  He said if it didn't work out between us that I could get my things and I could leave. <BR> Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes.
1927,I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic. <BR> Sorry Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
1928,"I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery. <BR> Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it? <BR> They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it. <BR> Why didn't they?--who told them not to? <BR> Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on. <BR> Mitchell knew then. <BR> Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman. <BR> Haldeman too? <BR> You get nothing from me about Haldeman?"
1929,Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ... <BR> How you doing man? <BR> All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ? <BR> You know where the others are?

1934,I had a partner and she fucked me. <BR> I won't. <BR> I think we're going to find out.
1935,"Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me. <BR> All I told them was the truth. <BR> They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them. <BR> They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up. <BR> What? What are you talking about? <BR> I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment... <BR> Why? <BR> I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993. <BR> They were the ones that put us together. <BR> Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that. <BR> This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me. <BR> They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done. <BR> You're... quitting? <BR> There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too."
1936,Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs. <BR> Prove it. <BR> Prove it how?
1937,Wait a minute. Do I get from you that she wants to pay me alimony? <BR> That's putting it crudely but
1938,How did those holes get there? <BR> Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
1939,Within no time everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot. <BR> We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around hustlin' around? <BR> What are you trying to handicap me? <BR> I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean I - I want to settle down. I want a family. <BR> You got the wrong girl Sam. <BR> I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother. <BR> You don't know me. What you've known me two three months. What do you know? <BR> I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore. <BR> You know a lot of happily married people Sam? 'Cause I don't. <BR> Yeah I know all that. <BR> I care about you a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you. <BR> I - I - I... <BR> Understand?  I'm sorry. <BR> No I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But you know what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that. <BR> If it doesn't work out. You know if it doesn't play out then what happens to me? <BR> You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so whatever happens if it doesn't work out between us I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids especially you know I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine. <BR> What're you... what're you pitching me here? <BR> Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you.  Want to take a chance?
1940,You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you! <BR> They don't love me. They love Monkeybone. <BR> It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there... <BR> That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on Doc I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you. <BR> Can't you give it to me later? <BR> Yeah I <u>could</u> but the thing is if later got here sooner it would be...better.
1941,Here you go. <BR> What's this? <BR> A fine for five hundred dollars. <BR> WHAT?
1942,"Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour... <BR> You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark..."
1943,The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left... <BR> No the problem as I recall was the lack of blocking...
1944,Okay. I wish you could come. <BR> This is it. The night we met. My God it's over.
1945,Not quite. This is my field. <BR> Is there anything that isn't? <BR> The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'... <BR> Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ? <BR> Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ... <BR> But if someone miniaturized the process... <BR> That's what we were working on. <BR> Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
1946,A private investigator... Youre not Austrian? <BR> Should I be? <BR> Whats a French private investigator doing here? <BR> Can I get up now? <BR> No! What do you want here? How do you know me? <BR> As you know from speaking to Phil your friend Leon has disappeared Rhian. His family have hired me to find him. <BR> ...Leons not here. How did you get here? Phil doesnt know where I live. <BR> Well I obviously do. And I also know that Leons not here Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should look for him. <BR> You thought wrong. I havent seen Leon for months. <BR> Havent you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine Rhian? Id have sworn you expect him to be in trouble. <BR> You-youre wrong. I just called to ask if I could stay with him next time Im in London. Thats all.
1947,We just found another body. <BR> Who's? <BR> Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school. Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder. <BR> Jesus. Any word from Brent? <BR> Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert. <BR> Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school. <BR> Ok.
1948,So. When is the wedding. <BR> Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
1949,Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me - <BR> Yes you already did. <BR> I did?
1950,You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it. <BR> Oh I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says... <BR> 
1951, <BR> I know George I was there. I'm not denying that she's good. <BR> She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring Lyla. <BR> We know that... <BR> Can I have an evil twin? <BR> No George we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year remember? <BR> Oh of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens. <BR> I don't know George... <BR> I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say? <BR> I'll think about it. <BR> It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here! <BR> I said I'll think about it. <BR> Fine but promise me one thing. If we use her I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery. <BR> Actually she was my discovery... just like you. <BR> Hmm? <BR>  <BR> ...yeah.

1954,"Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow. <BR> Yuri... are you... <BR> Sera... please go."
1955,Sources have told this reporter that the real reason your Park's opening has been delayed was a near-fatal accident on one of the rides here. Comment? <BR> I wouldn't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded Beanie Babies hadn't tested 100% safe.
1956,Mission control to Chuck come in... <BR> You're late.

1958,I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true? <BR> No!

1959,You go shoot me if you want Vincent but you'll be dead before I hit the ground. <BR> I don't want you dead woman I want the the truth!
1960,Well congratulations.  Isn't that great David? <BR> Certainly is.
1961,Well get on the phone and <u>get</u> it... <BR>  <BR> Oh Lord....
1962,It's not a good case. It's a very good case. <BR> A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child she's given the wrong anesthetic... <BR> ...we we love her Dick and me... <BR> ...I'm sure you do... <BR> But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her... <BR> ...I know. I went... <BR> ...You saw her? <BR> Yes. Yes I have. <BR> You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her and he took her kids... They they they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment. <BR> ...fifty thousand dollars? <BR> I don't want to leave her. Dick... the the... and Father Laughlin he said that it was God's will... <BR> ...I understand... <BR> My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue... <BR> ...I understand... <BR> ...But Dick he's looking for two years in Tucson... and they called him up and said to come out. He's a good man. He's only trying to do what's right.
1963,Wow. You're a walking felony. <BR> Thank you. Having fun? <BR> Now I am. <BR> I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here. <BR> That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos. <BR> Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year. <BR> Elle c'mon there's no way you'll get the grades to qualify for one of those spots. You're not smart enough.
1964,Ted it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words. <BR> Just say it Dad. <BR> I know they were simple people but did this trip help your college fund at all? <BR> Dad let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore. <BR> Well good. Every little bit helps.
1965,We have forty-eight hours the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions. <BR> And then? <BR> And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
1966,Whenever we got local merch we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know Arabs. <BR> What are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
1967,Neil you could have burned the house down! <BR> I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
1968,Don't leave us Conner. <BR> It's not for me to decide.
1969,How is Lillian? I haven't seen her. <BR> She wants a divorce. <BR> Don't talk like that. <BR> It's over finished and done with. <BR> That sounds so final. But are we really surprised? <BR> I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen. <BR> But didn't we know it would happen? <BR> Don't needle me Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do. <BR> Joanna Bourne. So rich and crisp. This woman lets you touch her body? You put your hands on her personal parts?
1970,Oh.  Sorry. <BR> Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process. <BR> Put your head back. <BR> Two days ago would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully? <BR> No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you. <BR> Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
1971,The arrangement is over! <BR> No kidding. NO KIDDING! <BR> And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street. <BR> I'll get your cash. You haven't been straight with me ever since I met you! You never loved me in the first place!  I need eyes in the back of my fuckin' head with you you fuckin' bitch!
1972,Holy shit. Can you believe this? <BR> Pretty nice. <BR> See man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets. <BR> What's the movie? <BR> I'll get the girl. <BR> Nah don't bother --
1973,You know there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys. <BR> What? <BR> You didn't tell me that they can be so nice so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old. <BR> You're right. I didn't tell you that.
1974,What the hell are you doing here? <BR> We got to talk.
1975,You look very pretty. <BR> Oh no I just lost a little weight that's all.  Well you look nice. <BR> You see I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married. <BR> Oh Alvy come on. <BR> Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land. <BR> Well whatta you mean? I mean it's perfectly fine out here. I mean Tony's very nice and uh well I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean that's... that's a very big step for me you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more. <BR> So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York? <BR>  <BR>  <BR>  <BR> That's right 'cause it's an important issue. <BR> Alvy you're incapable of enjoying life you know that? I mean your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself. <BR> I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know if one guy is starving someplace that's... you know I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what? <BR> No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends. <BR> Okay.  Check please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I... <BR> You're mad aren't you? <BR> No.  Yes of course I'm mad because you love me I know that. <BR> Alvy I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean you know how wonderful you are. I mean you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing and-and- and you know get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway look I don't wanna- Listen listen listen uh  h'h so whatta you up to anyway huh? <BR> The usual you know. Uh tryin' t' write. I'm workin' on a play.  Jesus. So whatta yuh saying? That you're not comin' back to New York with me?
1976,You see somebody went to a lot of trouble here and I want to find out lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem. <BR> What do you mean? <BR> May I speak frankly Mrs. Mulwray? <BR> You may if you can Mr. Gittes. <BR> Well that little girlfriend she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere. <BR> Suppose they did. How does it concern you? <BR> Nothing personal Mrs. Mulwray I just -- <BR> It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you? <BR> Look at it this way. Now this phony broad excuse the language says she's you she's hired me. Whoever put her up to it didn't have anything against me. They were out to get your husband. Now if I see him I can help him.  Did you talk this morning?
1977,They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS. <BR> Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
1978,Put the fucking kettle down. <BR> John. <BR> Put the fucking kettle down. Tell Yuri tell him put it down or I'm going to make him.
1979,Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of met in the elevator -- <BR> Yeah sure.  I'm Corky. <BR> I heard you working in here and I just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee?
1980,Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up. And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now. <BR> Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash get that Scagnetti fuck off your back and we'll be talking to ya. <BR> Daddy I got an idea. Now just hear it out. I know you don't like to use any of the boys on these jobs but technically Vic ain't one of the boys. He's been gone for four years. He ain't on no one's list. Ya know he can handle himself ya know you can trust him.
1981,How far did you go?  Was it cold? <BR> You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
1982,I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible. <BR> You were there? <BR> I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers... <BR> Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
1983,What're you talking about man?  I don't understand. <BR> What a surprise... <BR> I got a surprise for you blondie...
1984,I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust--  Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power-- <BR> It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world. <BR> Now that you understand the situation more clearly perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President <BR> I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations.  I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions. <BR> Our problems are very complex Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly. <BR> I can judge only by what I see. <BR> Your impatience is quite understandable. <BR> I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it. <BR> I'm afraid my people haven't.  I'm very sorry -- I wish it were otherwise.
1985,No brag. Just fact. <BR> Got you for -- 450 500 bucks? 
1986,Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again.  Did you? <BR> Of course not.  That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.
1987,Yes!  That's it!  You got it you got it! Way to go Chief! <BR> I'm doing it!  I'm doing it!
1988,Brown's dead we don't know about Blue. <BR> Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
1989,Look if what you say is true if there's a chance I could turn into one of them then I've got no choice do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself. <BR> There is no cure. <BR> You don't know that.
1990,Who are you? <BR> I think you know. Your eyes say you do. <BR> [Beat] You're his son? <BR> No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me old man. I'm the real thing. <BR> How...how are you here?
1991,Waal Mr. Moss I wouldn't.... <BR> You wouldn't be here if it wasn't true.  It's true right?
1992,Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter. <BR> Ladies and gentleman Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree! <BR> You saw that article? God isn't it awful? My mother sent that in. <BR> I take it she likes the guy. <BR> You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching? <BR> Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore? <BR> She said not to come home until graduation. <BR> Wow you got thrown out? For Dante? <BR> What can I say? He does weird things to me. <BR> Can I watch? <BR> You can hold me down. <BR> Can I join in? <BR> You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite. <BR> Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around? <BR> A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try. <BR> Wow. Hey I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese right? <BR> Dick. <BR> Exactly. <BR> So where is he? <BR> He went home to change for the big date. <BR> God isn't he great? <BR> No this is great. <BR> Can I use the bathroom? <BR> There's no light back there. <BR> Why aren't there any lights? <BR> Well there are but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night. <BR> You're kidding. <BR> Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it because the electrician owes money to the video store. <BR> Such a sordid state of affair. <BR> And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss and my desire to piss with the light on. <BR> I'll try to manage.
1993,Ask me what I want to change about this moment. <BR> What do you want to change about this moment? <BR> Nothing.
1994,"- it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say- <BR> Where'd you get all that information? <BR> Eve. <BR> Eve? <BR> She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her... <BR> That was a pity... <BR> She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo... <BR> I wonder why."
1995,I read the hospital report on your client. <BR> ...Deborah Ann Kaye... <BR> ...Deborah Ann Kaye...
1996,You be careful Tommy. Don't you be stickin' your nose in anything. <BR> Okay Ma. Don't you worry.
1997,Look Jeffrey. <BR> Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
1998,Who was that? <BR> I'm having the floor fixed <BR> And what was that neighbor guy doing here? <BR> Philip what are <u>you</u> doing here? <BR> Look I think we should work things out.
1999,If you can't look anymore I understand... <BR> As long as they're dead... <BR> These are all dead Will.
2000,Their asses are here but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily. <BR> Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy. <BR> We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze. <BR> An intelligent plan Mr. Luciano but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat. <BR> Don't worry. I got friends to take care of that.
2001,What show is this? <BR> It's the news Buffy. <BR> Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie. <BR> I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important. <BR> Mmmnkay.
2002,"We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes. <BR> Fine. You got five... <BR> It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here? <BR> Are you kidding me? What's to like?"
2003,"Thanks, Jack.  You sure throw a helluva party. <BR>  <BR> Well uh Trini and I have an early plane.  We were hoping to get back to New York in time for ..."
2004,Didn't happen yesterday I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat. <BR> Then it happened before they scuttled her.
2005,"I... I had a visitor. <BR> What? <BR> Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help! <BR> Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I... <BR> I know. No-one can. But I have to save him. Where's the other doctor? He said He'd listen. He promised."
2006,That stuff's two hours cold. <BR> I know. <BR> I put a cigarette out in it.
2007,4000 degrees is usually the point of....? <BR> Vocasity <BR> No Tetanty.
2008,Ebby's told me a lot about you. <BR> Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee?
2009,Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism. <BR> He kicked major ass and you know it.
2010,Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck! <BR> Caesar someone could see us out here.
2011,Thereve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially its just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee? <BR> I wouldnt mind. Thank you.
2012,That's crazy. <BR> No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there...  <BR> Where -- <BR> Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
2013,Come on down guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes! <BR> Oh yeah!
2014,Here's your ticket ma'am. <BR> Oh thank you. Thank you very much.  Here. <BR> Oh thank you. Thank you. <BR> When does the bus leave? <BR> In about fifteen minutes. <BR> Thank you.
2015,I think it's starting again. You know... there was something peculiar.  If only I knew... <BR> Peculiar?  You mean like back then? <BR> Yes something was...
2016,She looks like she stinks. <BR> Cat fight cat fight.
2017,"Okay, Starling. Let's have it. <BR> You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there. <BR> What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab. <BR> You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked. <BR> Are you finished? <BR> He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford."
2018,What? <BR> I actually know this one. <BR> You do? <BR> Yeah this song's older than me if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom. <BR> That's almost interesting Mark. Who did you dance with? <BR> Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt. <BR> Oh man I can just picture you slow dancing like a dork!
2019,And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ... <BR> What attitude? <BR> You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses. <BR> He's a guest in my house isn't he? <BR> Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him. <BR> Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
2020,Is this Rome?  Are we just going to be executed? <BR> They can't... if this is Rome...
2021,Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan? <BR> All right. Pay attention.
2022,We're going to need lots of good luck aren't we? <BR> Nobody ever had too much.
2023,We did. It got lost in the shuffle. <BR> What? <BR> We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands. <BR> What's more important than sanitation? <BR> The safety of the men -- that's more important! Five accidents this week -- all because of speed-up. You're a woman you don't know what it's like up there.
2024,But to someone from the planet Krypton this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah Kryptonite! That's the stuff! <BR> You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him but this kind of rock -- <BR> Will kill him! And I'm going to have a piece of the rock! Miss Teschmacher pack your --

2026,I thought you had a girlfriend. <BR> Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you? <BR> No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends. <BR> She won't? Why not? <BR> I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me. <BR> Yeah. I can understand that.
2027,He's got to help or it won't work. <BR> Sean baby please....
2028,Oh my God... <BR>  <BR> Yeah. Yeah it kind of does.
2029,I've got some good news. <BR> What's that? <BR> Annette will see you.
2030,I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died. <BR> Well I don't care if it's legal or not we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
2031,I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current. <BR> You're more practical than superstitious. <BR> Only way to be.
2032,Which way? <BR> Juarez - Chihuahua City road. <BR> Don't you want to go to the airport? <BR> Not now.
2033,Can you pay some attention to me? <BR> Oh yes. <BR> Insolent young cub! <BR> You mean Baron von Gaigern? <BR> Baron! <BR> Well he's a gentleman!
2034,Now remember you're not gonna kill anyone right? <BR> Right.
2035,... plastic. <BR> Wow that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison. <BR> Poison?  I'm surprised at you.  You lack vision Mr. O'Brien. <BR> You're lacking a few things too: ethics morals common decency and oh yeah deodorant.
2036,Could you ever conceive of going to Italy Tom persuade my son to come home?  I'd pay you. I'd pay you 1000 dollars. <BR> I've always wanted to go to Europe sir but... <BR> Good. Now you can go for a reason.
2037,God damn. <BR> You find something Georgie? <BR> Yep I found something.
2038,What should I know? <BR> To begin with where Mary is. Do you? <BR> No. I take it you don't either?  How long? <BR> Last Friday. She left work and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her not even a phone call. <BR> And you thought she'd come up here to me? If she had what reason would she have for not calling you? <BR> A good reason I suppose. <BR> Well what do you think we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and... <BR> Mr. Loomis you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing. <BR> I was getting to that! <BR> What do you know about it? <BR> Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive. <BR> Look if you two are in this thing together I don't care it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and...
2039,What's wrong with that? <BR> I'm not sure about this. <BR> I know you're afraid of something. We'll be careful. Tomorrow we'll go over there and we'll find out.
2040,You never wanna try anything new Alvy. <BR> How can you say that? I mean  who said I-I-I-I said that you I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome. <BR> That's sick! <BR> Yeah I know it's sick but it's new. You know you didn't say it couldn't be sick.

It - <BR> It looked like a fuckin' gun! <BR> You - You fuckin' moron I'll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit you... <BR> Oh my God what are we gonna do? I'm sorry. <BR> ...fuckin' jerk-off.
2042,In many ways the church-bound tradition of the father son and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all. It's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology. <BR> You're saying that Christ is the child and -- <BR> -- And God the angry parent and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self. <BR> All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in? <BR> You ask what the point is? <BR> That's right. <BR> Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization? <BR> I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed. <BR> If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My I sound a bit -- <BR> I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude. <BR> You weren't. You actually for some reason you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself. <BR> But not too ashamed. <BR> Now you are being rude. <BR> And you're still trying to get me into bed. <BR> Ouch.
2043,You're parents at that party? <BR> Yeah. Yours? <BR> You get in trouble? <BR> Maybe. Can't really tell yet. <BR> I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to you know... unless you really want to. <BR> Yeah.
2044,Boy. It sure has been a long time. <BR> We were here two Christmases ago. <BR> Well that's a long time. <BR> It's not that long. <BR>  <BR> SO! <BR> You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me my brother at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch! <BR> Oh Jesus. <BR> I simply can not stand that tone!
2045,I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot? <BR> Well you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you. <BR> For me?  It's Shell Oil.
2046,Oh - Sugar! <BR> I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal. <BR> It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together. <BR> If it hadn't been for you they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere sitting on my ukulele. <BR> It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele - <BR> If there's anything I can do for you - <BR> Oh I can think of a million things -
2047,I want to die. <BR> Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
2048,Why! <BR> I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation. <BR> And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to? <BR> He asked.
2049,Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee. <BR> Shit here we go. <BR> You didn't want to see me did you? <BR> If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women it's all the fucking mind reading. <BR> What are you afraid of? <BR> I'm not afraid of anything. <BR> I don't understand - ? <BR> I know!  You can't understand because we're different Violet.  We're different. <BR> We're not that different Corky. <BR> How can you sit in that bed and say that? <BR> Because it's the truth. <BR> Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you there is a little dyke just like me? <BR> Oh no she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you. <BR> Is that what her daddy tells her? <BR> I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder. <BR> What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men? <BR> I don't. <BR> For Christ's sake Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls remember? <BR> What you heard wasn't sex. <BR> What the fuck was it? <BR> All my life everyone has been telling me that when I have sex I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex. <BR> What was it then? <BR> Work.
2050,Hello? <BR> I'm looking for Lisa Sherman. <BR> She's not here. <BR> You know where I can find her? <BR> St. Michael's. <BR> She works at a church? <BR> She resides there. Out back. She died a year and a half ago.
2051,No silly - I'm still in school you know. but I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful Jeffrey. <BR> I will.  I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five okay?
2052,Well why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me? <BR> It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
2053,Look our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you we did some re-analysis of the numbers and honestly we'd really like a chance to do a bit better.  I'm assuming you're still in the market.  It's the same vessel? <BR> Yes. <BR> We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job as I said a bit more competitive. <BR> Okay.
2054,That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving <BR> We don't -- ?
2055,I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today fella you're on your way out... They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case. Now this is it today. <BR> I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me. <BR> Listen to me fella... <BR> No no you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears I can't get a continuance and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
2056,How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...? <BR> Anyone got another set of sails?
2057,A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right. <BR> The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is. <BR> We all know what right is Senator.
2058,I'll have to see what the visions say about that one. <BR> You didn't have another vision...
2059,This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith? <BR> No...
2060,Mason uhm John I have something to tell you.  You know that pardon= contract you signed? <BR> Womack ripped it up right? <BR> You knew?  All this time? <BR> I'm not a fool Billy. <BR> All I know is that whatever you did you don't deserve to go back.
2061,Why not? <BR> You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.
2062,You knew a second ago.  <u>Who</u> started it? <BR> -- A man.
2063,"Hi, Betty. You're looking good... <BR> Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning... <BR> Oh, appreciate it. I was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to..."
2064,Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else... <BR> I'll never get over it. <BR> Yes you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate success or failure - whatever it is it's here it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone. <BR> I wish I could believe that. <BR> Give yourself time. Don't worry too much about what people think you're very young and very talented...  ... and believe it or not if there's anything I can do-
2065,No I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him.  <BR> Do you still talk to Sylvan? <BR> I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends. <BR> That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy all right? <BR> I will. Take it easy. <BR> Bye.  <BR> Bye  That was Snowball.
2066,I am Sir...Sergeant Al Powell. <BR> Dwayne Robinson.  Well what have you learned?  What do they want? <BR> The terrorists?  Don't know Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them. <BR> Then who the hell have you been talking too? <BR> We don't exactly know Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others. <BR> He claims?  Powell has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who -- <BR> I don't think so Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD but definitely a badge. <BR> How do you know? <BR> A hunch.  Things he said.  Like knowing how to recognize a phony ID -- <BR> -- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ Powell he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
2067,That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person. <BR> Yes it does. <BR> No it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me. <BR> I can't win with you. <BR> It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously. <BR> I do not. <BR> Lighten up. <BR> I am lighten. Can we drop this? <BR> Fine.
2068,Yah pretty good. <BR> Whatcha watchin' there? <BR> Norstars. <BR> ...Who they playin'? <BR> OOOoooh!  His reaction synchronizes with a reaction from the crowd.
2069,Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me. <BR> I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God. <BR> But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne? <BR> But it is what I want. <BR> To be killed in battle? <BR> If God wants me to win he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
2070,Twenty-five thousand? For yourself? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Why do you need that much? <BR> Well what's the difference? I just need it. <BR> Well I mean... you know I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn you know. I mean... <BR> I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself. <BR> Who's fighting? I mean I'm you know tell me what it's for.
2071,Sup. Sup. <BR> Come on nigga. Sup sup then? Stop faking moves. <BR> I'm gonna fuck you up bitch.

2073,I don't know what you're raving about young man. And furthermore I'm not interested. <BR> Wellof all thewell  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
2074,You have to stop doing that! <BR> I'll work on it...
2075,He was incredible.  This guy is fearless.  He has no fear. <BR> That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'. <BR> Well there is that ... <BR> I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers?
2076,Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich come enjoy it. <BR> What do you mean? <BR> Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you. <BR> Save it for Bourne. <BR> What?

2081,Aren't they precious?  Ma'am she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area? <BR> No.  Well her grandparents are down in Oklahoma but that's it... <BR> I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore? <BR> No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back. <BR> Her show? <BR> 
2082,Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know. <BR> Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
2083,I think it kind of looks like my friend Paulie. <BR> Oh is he bald and amorphous? <BR> No he's the dad.

2085,"I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and -- <BR> What's so special about it?"

2094,Here you are. <BR> It shall not happen again Monsieur. <BR> That's all right.
2095,No Ilsa I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me somehow I will get out and join you. <BR> But Victor if the situation were different if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one would you take it? <BR> Yes I would.
2096,There's another one I like I read. It's by Pope Alexander. <BR> Alexander Pope? <BR> Yes shit. Oops sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out. <BR> It's no big deal. <BR> You are such a sweetheart.

2103,I'm in a hurry. <BR> You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are. <BR> No applause!
2104,Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....  oh 20 minutes. <BR> Great good.
2105,Barman -- whiskey --  For you Mr. Kringelein? <BR> For me? -- Oh please something sweet and cold.
2106,They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm maybe very warm. <BR> I can't hold up my head anymore.
2107,We'll die if we stay here! <BR> You'll die if you leave here.
2108,Friedmans dead... They killed him... <BR> So who... Whos the man? Where is he? <BR> Some Italian I picked up back there. Hes in the boot of the Mustang. <BR> Italian? The Mafia...? <BR> Who knows. Who cares...  You wanted slime. You got slime.
2109,You know you don't have to do this. <BR> I'm fine I really am. <BR> I admire your strength. <BR> We all have to be strong right? <BR> Right.

2111,Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca. <BR> Thank you Captain. It's very good to be here. <BR> Major Strasser my aide Lieutenant Casselle.
2112,Sure  You're working on the passports...  ... and visas? <BR> They will be ready. You guys do your job. <BR> I'll take care of my end. <BR> Stay clean.
2113,Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset. <BR> We're not canceling. <BR> I know. <BR> I won't even discuss it. <BR> No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back. <BR> I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow. <BR> Don't we already have someone to do that for us? <BR> Yeah. You. <BR> Okay. Okay.
2114,You're lawyers.  How can you let this shit go by!  Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this. <BR> You did say it sir. <BR> Never.  I never said that about Jews!
2115,So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded baby? <BR> Only one way I can think of Sweetheart.
2116,My husband and I will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in Israel. Deborah will be here if you need anything before our return. <BR> Fine. One more thing Mrs and Mr Spitz; may I ask what is or was your occupation?
2117,And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe hundreds thousands would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast. <BR> Herr Laszlo you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape. <BR> You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France. Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.
2118,"What?! That you had something to do with it? <BR> I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't... <BR> Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this... <BR> There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God... <BR> Okay, okay, look, ummm... Let's just talk a little first and you'll feel better, I promise."
2119,Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply? <BR> Uh-huh.  And when we get there we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home. <BR> Well then let's climb abroad.
2120,And what about for you? <BR> Huh? <BR> What about for you? <BR> For me?  I'll have the same thing.  <BR> Do me a favor will you? <BR> What's that Sol? <BR>  <BR> What's the difference? <BR> It's simpler that's what. It makes things go faster. <BR>  <BR> Thanks. I knew you'd understand.
2121,I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny when you think there's an answer to everything you think you know all the answers. <BR> We were going to get married. Are going to get married! <BR> Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter Sam. <BR> This is the old highway. <BR> I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper. <BR> Watch your tenses. <BR> Huh? <BR> She always tries to be proper.
2122,Where is my family? <BR> Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you. <BR> And my army would have thrown your body into the Danube.
2123,"Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz. <BR> Never heard of him... <BR> Cicatriz is Mex for <U>Scar</U>...an' he has a white girl in his tepee...Be seein' you..."
2124,Stan! <BR> Dude I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now! <BR> Sweet.
2125,Alright we know who we're looking for.  Play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again. <BR> Or worse we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.
2126,I'll do it.  No more. <BR> Are you serious? <BR> Yeah ... I'm out. <BR> Is that the truth? <BR> I'll never run again.  I promise.
2127,She's not there <BR> No......  She's dead THX........ <BR> You don't know that! <BR> All right...
2128,If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you anyway? <BR> I'm not very bright I guess. <BR> I wouldn't say that.  Careless maybe. <BR> No just dumb.  If I had any brains I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band. <BR> Then why did you take this job? <BR> I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more. <BR> Afford it? <BR> Have you ever been with a male band? <BR> Me? <BR> That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh brother! <BR> Rough? <BR> I'll say. <BR> You can't trust those guys. <BR> I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo! <BR> Bingo? <BR> You see I have this thing about saxophone players. <BR> Really? <BR>  <BR> That so? <BR> Every time! <BR> You know - I play tenor sax. <BR> But you're a girl thank goodness. <BR> Yeah. <BR> That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums. <BR> Yeah. <BR> You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses - <BR> You don't say? <BR> Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste all squeezed out. <BR> Men! <BR> So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job and the next saxophone player and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright. <BR> Brains aren't everything. <BR> I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
2129,Dinoine chagantakat! <BR> Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
2130,M'lady...? <BR> I understand you saved my son's life today. <BR> God smiled upon us. <BR> And you were not hurt? <BR> No M'lady. <BR> That is good.
2131,What is this going to cost? <BR> It's completely done on a contingency basis. That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third... that is of course the usual arrangement...
2132,This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas? <BR> According to this tag. <BR> And you're looking for?
2133,Giving you money makes me want to come. <BR> Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
2134,Go on. <BR> Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
2135,Sorry to bother you Bud. <BR> Yes sir. Like you to meet Opal.
2136,No it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying. <BR> Thank you. <BR> Thank you?  Dick sometimes I understand why they hate you.
2137,I gotta be fucking crazy. <BR> Yeah but are you crazy enough?
2138,You snore. <BR> So I hear. <BR> No offense Professor Tripp but you look sorta crappy. <BR> He's right you look horrible.
2139,A car ... a car accident. <BR> Are you okay? <BR> I think so. I was just taking a shower. <BR> Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
2140,Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels. <BR> Hey listen-I mean he was a terrific actor and look at him he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey I don't think you like emotion too much.
2141,Ninety-five miles an hour. <BR> He looks great just great!
2142,Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time. <BR> Snifter are for warm drinks -- <BR> Yeah snifters are for cognac -- <BR> When served warm -- <BR> What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker? <BR> We have snifters <BR> Then put my Martel's in a snifter.
2143,So what did he say when he called? <BR> Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty and would we mind driving up with his things.  Fucking kids huh? They take you for granted every time.
2144,Now children no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance.  <BR> I'll remember you Mr. Kringelein.
2145,I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions. <BR> Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
2146,That I suppose makes everythinguhquite all right. <BR> Oh this?I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet but a lot safer. You see I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.
2147,I can't see him at all.  He's been destroyed. <BR> No look!  Three degrees from the central azimuth.
2148,Dante let me grab a Gatorade. <BR> If you grab a Gatorade then everybody's going to grab one. <BR> So? <BR> So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades. <BR> What do you care? Hey what smells like shoe polish? <BR> I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks. <BR> What responsibility? You're closing the fucking store to play hockey.
2149,Oh Lord.... <BR> ...those limp-dick ... <u>turncoat</u>... I <u>thought</u> they let us out of there too easy..... <BR> War's over Pal.  <BR> Gloria -- sell the House.  
2150,Well is it? <BR> What? <BR> Parked outside? <BR> No not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.
2151,Lombard this is not a Jewish name is it? <BR> I hope its not too significant. <BR> What if it is? <BR> Well I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning Mrs Spitz. I wouldnt like to think Id kept you waiting for nothing.
2152,Mrs. Straub! <BR> I've killed my husband! <BR> What? <BR> I think I've killed him.  Martin my husband I've killed him!  That is I'm not sure but...
2153,Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first. <BR> What's wrong.
2154,You're in the stomach! Let me try. <BR> One more time!
2155,Please do not be frightened Madam. <BR> What do you want here? <BR> Nothing -- only to be here. <BR> Why do you hide in my room? <BR> But surely you must know -- because I love you. <BR> Because you love me -- you love me?
2156,Woa dude who's your girlfriend's new guy? <BR> She's not my girlfriend dude!
2157,...So I guess that's it then.  Here's the keys - <BR> No that's not it Jerry. <BR> Huh? <BR> The new vehicle plus forty thousand dollars. <BR> Yah but the deal was the car first see then the forty thousand like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you - <BR> Shep didn't tell us much Jerry. <BR> Well okay it's - <BR> Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30. <BR> Yah well that was a mix-up then. <BR> Yeah you already said that. <BR> Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and - <BR> I'm not gonna debate you Jerry. <BR> Okay. <BR> I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense. <BR> Oh no it's real sound. It's all worked out. <BR> You want your own wife kidnapped? <BR> Yah.
2158,Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady. <BR> Mr. Brady's a cop.
2159,And will the dead ever return Freya? <BR> That I cannot tell you.
2160,Would you like a drink? It's right beside you... <BR> I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
2161,We believe you Woody.  Right Rex? <BR> Oh I don't like confrontations.
2162,Hello? <BR> Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.
2163,Well? <BR> Well what? <BR> Aren't you going to say anything? <BR> What do you want me to say? <BR> I don't know. Hello Mom. Hello Dad. Something like that. <BR> I don't got no daddy you dig? I got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.
2164,Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way you either do it or you don't. All or nothing. <BR> OK. <BR> David?
2165,Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow. <BR> He ain't the only one.
2166,What's that you're playing? <BR> Just a little something of my own. <BR> Well stop it. You know what I want to hear. <BR> No I don't. <BR> You played it for her and you can play it for me. <BR> Well I don't think I can remember it. <BR> If she can stand it I can. Play it! <BR> Yes boss.
2167,This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether too. It'll take a little time. <BR> I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*! <BR> It's all very normal.
2168,Guess who I saw today. <BR> Who? <BR> Doctor David Ravell. <BR> What? Where was he?! <BR> ON TELEVISION!!  Cut the shit will you!
2169,D'Artagnan you will hunt down Aramis Porthos and Athos and bring me their heads or I will have yours.  And as for you Phillippe... Back to the prison you shall go and into the mask you hate. <BR> No Louis!  No! <BR> Wear it until you love it.  And die in it!!
2170,What is going on here Satch?  What are those guys doing out there? <BR> I think you know Frank. <BR> No I don't. <BR> Let's go outside and talk.  We need to do that. <BR> About what? <BR> Let's go.  Do us both a favor.
2171,If I could have anything... this would almost do. <BR> Yeah almost...
2172,Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em practice up out here. <BR> Yeah. Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray?
2173,That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office. <BR> You mean Delaware? <BR> No. New York. <BR> New York? You're not the Company President by any chance? <BR> No ... <BR> Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike? <BR> Well if that's possible ... <BR> It's possible. Just negotiate. <BR> Are we talking to a union spokesman?
2174,"If you ate at the Tip Top you did. <BR> Oh, yes, with the coffee... <BR> Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup."
2175,I'm just going to get the name of their truck! <BR> I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
2176,That's my son! My son is dead! <BR> I'm sorry. <BR> You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE! <BR> WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
2177,Do you have chromium tapes?  The others fog in high- <BR> -humidity I know.  Highest lead density on the market.
2178,Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody? <BR> A few cops. <BR> No real people? <BR> Uh-uh just cops. <BR> Could you believe Mr. Blonde? <BR> That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that? <BR> I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door and you're standing in my way one way of the other you're gettin' outta my way. <BR> That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years and takin' out some stupid motherfucker ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked or ya think he's just trigger-happy? <BR> I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do is shoot up the place and kill everybody. <BR> What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean Jesus Christ how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty maybe twenty-one? <BR> Did ya see what happened to anybody else? <BR> Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that I don't know what went down. <BR> At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out I never looked back. <BR> What do you think? <BR> What do I think? I think the cops caught them or killed 'em. <BR> Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole. <BR> Yeah and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away where the fuck are they? <BR> You don't think it's possible one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a - <BR> Nope. <BR> How can you be so sure? <BR> I got the diamonds. <BR> Where? <BR> I got 'em all right? <BR> Where? Are they out in the car? <BR> No they're not in the car. No I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here. <BR> That was the plan we meet here. <BR> Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names but they can sing about this place. I mean that could be happening right now. As we speak the cops could be in their cars drivin' here this minute. <BR> I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed. <BR> What? <BR> Two jobs back it was a four man job we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop. <BR> No shit? <BR> Thank god we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it. <BR> So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up. <BR> I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit. <BR> Oh you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know you're the rat. <BR> For all I know you're the rat. <BR> Now you're using your head. For all we know he's the rat. <BR> That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat. <BR> Look asshole I'm right! Somebody's a fuckin' rat. How many times do I hafta say it before it sinks in your skull?
2179,Peter Warne!  <BR> Why? Do you know him?  <BR> Oh nono. <BR> You haven't heard from him have you Dad? <BR> Why no . . . Don't be silly. <BR> Oh please Dad
2180,"Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support... <BR> Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise. <BR> The ladies' - shall we say - lounge? <BR> Being violently ill to her tummy. <BR> It's good luck before an audition. She'll be all right once it starts."
2181,Calm down Kimmy.  It's not drugs just weed. <BR> Yeah you should have specified.
2182,Hey Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances? <BR> No - funerals. <BR> Would you mind rejoining the living? Goose it up a little.
2183,Jeez Bugsy. Ya like ta scared the crap outta me. <BR> Just wanted ta say hello.
2184,Woodward? <BR> Hmm? <BR> What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged all along the way leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone you know what that means? <BR> Only everything...
2185,Jesus what happened to you? <BR> It looks worse than it is. I'm okay. <BR> What happened? <BR> I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here. <BR> It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch. <BR> Yeah well I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville? <BR> Almost done. A week or ten days and I'll be there.
2186,They're on their way to Maui. <BR> No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
2187,No you're not calm. <BR> ...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't - I -
2188,I don't know I don't know I just know it. <BR> Marge there's female intuition and then there are facts --
2189,We'll figure out something. <BR> I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
2190,I am really deeply sorry. <BR> It violates so many trusts. <BR> It was an animal thing. No real intimacy. <BR> I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office. <BR> We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal. <BR> I'm glad we're having this talk. <BR> I feel great. I feel impeccably alive. I'm elated. Eat something. Please. I love you.
2191,Leave me alone. <BR> Benny was right.  You guys are all exactly the same.
2192,"What're you doing here, Roy? <BR> Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened... <BR> Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting! <BR> My God... did you get a look at who did it? <BR> Yes. <BR> You did? Was it anyone that you...? <BR> It was Chloe..."
2193,Doctor... <BR> Get her back!  I've got to go in!  Get me a full anesthetic STAT!
2194,This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again? <BR> Get ready to smile five guys per girl. <BR> I can live with thaaaa --
2195,Not for long Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation and you didn't deliver. <BR> What the fuck you talkin' about?
2196,Dude! <BR> What? Fuck you guys I wanna get out of here.
2197,How do you know? <BR> I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.
2198,What do they want?! <BR> What do you think they want?!
2199,Drink to me Kringelein -- it's my last chance. <BR> I do drink Baron -- I drink to you Baron and to win.  It's good -- come along Baron.
2200,If he's reasonable maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options. <BR> Yeah reconsider fucking his shit up.
2201,Jesus Christ is she for real? <BR> Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue. <BR> B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy. <BR> It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory. <BR> You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league. <BR> Care to make a wager on that? <BR> I'll think about it... <BR> Oh well duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art.
2202,You wouldn't have said that before you met her. <BR> I'd call it stupid at any time. <BR> Well that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding it will be with me. And if it's with someone else you can make it a permanent arrangement. <BR> So that's the way it is? <BR> That's the way I feel about it. <BR> I'm glad you told me. Good night Mr. Burton.
2203,NY Times Washington Post War War War.  Times got the girlscout page twelve Post in Section Two.... Horses in Mid-Stream...? <BR> I don't think you're gonna need it. <BR> Well we paid for it we got the guys on a retainer. <BR> They got the guys on a <u>retainer</u> it's cheaper <u>pay</u>'em but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone. <BR> What can it hurt. <BR> What can it hurt is they offend me.
2204,Is she dying? <BR> She's having a baby. Twins. <BR> Es impossible. <BR> You can trust me on this one. <BR> It's a miracle.
2205,None of it was my idea Carl--I didn't go looking for the job. <BR> Chapin did contact you then? <BR> Sure--off the record. <BR> On the orders of Haldeman? <BR> I don't know anything about Haldeman except Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit swim see some girls. <BR> It gets interesting if it was Haldeman because our word is that when Chapin says something he's gotten the OK from Haldeman and when Haldeman says something he's gotten the OK from the President. <BR> Can't help you. <BR> At USC you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
2206,Oh shit look who it is. The human vacuum. <BR> Scumbag. What are you doing? <BR> Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin. <BR> He's your cousin? <BR> Check this out he's from Russia. <BR> No way. <BR> I swear to God. Silent Bob am I lying?
2207,Dickie Greenleaf? <BR> Yes? <BR> Inspector Roverini. Can we come in?
2208,What were you talking about the other day? <BR> I wasn't talking about anything. <BR> Yeah you were. What you said about them taking me out to the woods...
2209,What's that? <BR> I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?
2210,Thanks for the movie Randy. <BR> Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
2211,Maybe you should have just a half. <BR> Thanks for the advice dad.
2212,Must've been some experience for you huh? <BR> Yes. <BR> I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime huh? <BR> I'm going back tomorrow.
2213,And to think -- they met at a key party of all things. <BR> A key party? <BR> You know it's a California thing. That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in L.A. you know the men put their car keys in a bowl and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever's keys they've got. Anyhow that's how she met this Rod person or whatever his name is and he's left his wife and she's packing for California. Irwin is devastated. It's so ironic.
2214,Ain't we good-timing here ... ? <BR> The family that steals together deals together... <BR> Dad'd be proud -- <BR> Maybe not. But Dad was from another era... <BR> What era was that -- ? <BR> The era when crime didn't pay -- <BR> As opposed to now Kid Car Crusher? <BR> Price of doing business... <BR> What about just getting a job 9 to 5 five days a week that whole mystery achievement -- ? <BR> 
2215,Oh Happy!  Dick Nixon ... You remember him. <BR> Hi Happy.  Well you're obviously making him happy. <BR> Repartee Dick -- very good.  Hey I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life? <BR> Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court. <BR> Won or lost? <BR> Lost. <BR> Someday Dick.
2216,You said... <BR> I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought thank God someone normal who doesn't know how interact at these things either. <BR> Yeah. I don't ever know what to say. <BR> I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable but yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod. <BR> Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?
2217,By the way Jeffrey this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone but me or other police personnel. Got it? <BR> Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did. <BR> Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
2218,What you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. Ya know if I keep on killin' people like I have I won't have no more friends left! <BR> You've got the public upset Al. <BR> But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it. <BR> When the people get so upset our politician friends gotta listen. <BR> What are ya tellin' me Charlie?
2219,I've got it!  Astounding! <BR> What? <BR> No one could have imagined anything one-thousandth as fantastic as the sober facts uncovered by patient inquiry.  This world is in a state of static-mobility:  we are at the same time moving and standing still.
2220,How the fuck can I open it? <BR> The same way you did before. <BR> What are you talking about?
2221,Cherry? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Unusual design for a contemporary piece.
2222,Hey Mike? <BR> What? Are you all right? <BR> I think we're making a lot of noise. <BR> I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
2223,What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect! <BR> What's that?
2224,Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years. <BR> That's the point isn't it? <BR> Yeah I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys huh Harp? <BR> Supervising Special Agent Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car okay Angelo?  Okay?
2225,Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook Kringelein. <BR> Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me Baron. <BR> Goodnight Kringelein.  <BR> No -- no please -- oh don't go -- don't go -- don't leave me alone Baron.
2226,I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me -- <BR> Okay.
2227,Trade Re1ations. <BR> You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber.  <BR> There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber <BR> That's what I'm telling you.  The two things:  the two things:  Rare strain of flu No Cause to Be Alarmed.  And the B-2 Bomber...  Clear me a space.  Get me a copy go rob one get it off the computer Wash Post N.Y. <u>TIMES</u>
2228,I am so sorry!  Forgive me I -- <BR> No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone! <BR> Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son? <BR> How did you know -- ? <BR> Porthos told me.
2229,That was good. <BR> Can we talk about something? <BR> Not now. I have an idea.
2230,It's Gino!  It's Gino! <BR> Where in the hell is he?
2231,He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet. <BR> He wasn't out when you were there. He just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. This fellow lives like a hermit...
2232,I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to GollieŤs. Okay. Any questions? <BR> Aren't we going a little hard? <BR> What do you have in mind? <BR> It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one. <BR> Dillinger got killed.
2233,Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me. <BR> Oh honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on you know where I am.
2234,Let's all go! Road trip! <BR> Wait -- Cecil has a condo in Tahoe. Let's go there!
2235,It's been a long time. <BR> Yes ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge. <BR> Some of the old songs Sam. <BR> Yes ma'am.
2236,Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming! <BR> Stop her!
2237,What's this? <BR> It's a scene. Memorize it. <BR> What? <BR> A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor and bad acting is bullshit in this job. <BR> But what is this? <BR> It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal. <BR> What? <BR> Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job. <BR> I gotta memorize all this shit? <BR> It's like a joke. You remember what's important and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it and sayin' it and sayin' it and sayin' it and sayin' it. <BR> I can do that. <BR> The things you gotta remember are the details. It's the details that sell your story. Now this story takes place in this men's room. So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap whether they got hot water or not 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room and you get one detail they remember right they'll swear by you.
2238,You out to buy a motel? <BR> No. <BR> Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask? <BR> I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble. <BR> I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble. <BR> I'm not the police. <BR> Oh.
2239,My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!? <BR> Her fella.
2240,Just a little when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help? <BR> It's complicated but [looking at Starks] in a way your father let me know how I'd get through to him. <BR> How? <BR> He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him. <BR> I don't understand. <BR> I still don't either even after all these years.
2241,One guy isn't gonna be so stupid. <BR> Maybe he isn't alone.
2242,Aren't I worth waiting for? <BR> Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress? <BR> I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life. <BR> The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips. <BR> Thanks Chuck.  I need the money.  Can I still work the hours around my classes?
2243,...on the line and this guy's out havin' the time of his life. He has every cop in the state watchin' him and he's out playin' golf. <BR> Practice enough this week you prick? <BR> And at the...
2244,She got it Bob.  A nineteen-year-old college kid ... <BR> What? <BR> She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA the Mafia the Wall Street bastards ... <BR> Sir? <BR> 
2245,Was there somebody in your room when I called you? <BR> W-w-whatta you mean? <BR> I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice. <BR> Oh I had the radio on. <BR> Yeah? <BR> I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television- <BR> Yeah.
2246,It wasn't his fault.  He thought it was his only way back.  They fleeced him real good. <BR> How?  How could they have gotten anything? <BR> They did the same to him as they did to you. <BR> What are you talking about... ?
2247,Resentful. <BR> When you have a lot of time to think it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned.
2248,[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you? <BR> Yes. <BR> Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do. <BR> I know. <BR> Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you. <BR> If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?
2249,Fight me from your horse or on foot but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me. <BR> I sought only not to harm you sir.
2250,Why? Isn't he sleeping here? <BR> No it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.
2251,"Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means. <BR> Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks..."
2252,You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make you nervous Corky? <BR> No.
2253,He's on to us! <BR> Shit! What are we gonna do? <BR> Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel. <BR> You can't buy Wade off. <BR> We bought you. <BR> That was me.
2254,They loved you.  And I killed them. <BR> How... how can... how can you be here and say this? <BR> I don't want you to forgive me.
2255,Fuck you too you white son-of-a-bitch. <BR> Good. I'm glad that's settled!
2256,Oh that mob downstairs. I guess I got so interested in the play I forgot all about them. <BR> I see. <BR> Have we got a play Anne? Oh have we got a play!  Of course most of it is Gallagher's. She did most of it. That brain of hers just snaps like that all the time.
2257,I want your best man on this! <BR> Don't worry Sir. I have the perfect one.
2258,Want me to take over? <BR> You want to split your hernia again?
2259,Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam! <BR> No. <BR> You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this. <BR> I'm going home. <BR> Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam! <BR> I'm going home Cynthia. <BR> Adam this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do. <BR> I'm going home. I'll call you later.
2260,Oh shit. <BR> Someone pop your balloon? <BR> No problem no problem.
2261,I'm sorry but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side. <BR> We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then when everybody's screamin' for peace we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over everybody will beg us to take. <BR> I thought we just wanted to be left alone to run our business.
2262,You know I've always considered myself a very clever girl. Smart. Good head on my shoulders that sort of thing never the wrong word at the wrong time... but then I'd never met Addison deWitt.  I remember once I had a tooth pulled. They gave me some anaesthetic - I don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way. I heard myself saying things I wasn't even thinking... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body and couldn't control what I did or said- <BR> - and you felt just like that talking to Addison. <BR> In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean but what he means- <BR> Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison? <BR> No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace. <BR> Let's not get over-dramatic. <BR> You've really got a low opinion of me haven't you? We'll I'll give you some pleasant news. I've been told off in no uncertain terms all over town. Miss Channing should be happy to hear that. To know how loyal her friends are - how much more loyal they are than she had a right to expect me to be...
2263,I'm going to say I'm 104% sure. <BR> Oh really? <BR> Look if I could give it to you now I would. But it probably looks like a Sea Monkey at this point so I think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter you know?
2264,Sit down! You're gonna fall out! <BR> Me fall? Let's get some drugs! <BR> Drugs??! <BR> Medicine man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health!
2265,Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem. <BR> It's a marble floor we can clean it up.
2266,Okay. But we want your promise for a fair trial in writing. Give us a written statement Mathieu and then we'll surrender. <BR> How can I give you this statement? <BR> We'll lower a basket from the window ... <BR> Okay I'll make the statement in writing ...
2267,They was some cops here Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n. <BR> It had to come I reckon soon or later. <BR> I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now. <BR> I could hide you Tommy. <BR> I know you would Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too. <BR> Awright Tommy. What you figger you gonna do? <BR> You know what I been thinkin' about Ma? About Casy. About what he said what he done an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it. <BR> He was a good man. <BR> I been thinkin' about us too--about our people livin' like pigs an' good rich lan' layin' fallow or maybe one fella with a million acres while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled-- <BR> Tommy they'll drive you an' cut you down like they done to Casy. <BR> They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me for one thing if not another. Until then... <BR> You don't aim to kill nobody Tom! <BR> No Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw anyways maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear Ma. I can't. I don't know enough. <BR> How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know? <BR> Well maybe it's like Casy says a fella ain't got a soul of his own but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then... <BR> Then what Tom? <BR> Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise an' live in the houses they build why I'll be there too. <BR> I don't understan' it Tom. <BR> Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han' Ma. Good-by.  <BR> Good-by Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us? <BR> Sure. Good-by. <BR> Good-by Tommy.
2268,Emma... <BR> He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you. <BR> Shhh... don't talk. <BR> I want to talk.  I just learned again.
2269,You going away? <BR> Just for a few hours.  Julie'll be with you.
2270,Dickie you can't even drive a car! No what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life. <BR> I absolutely agree with Marge.
2271,Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart. <BR> Then we will both die traitors d'Artagnan.
2272,Open your eyes Mr. Lounds. <BR> No. I don't want to see you. <BR> Mr. Lounds you're a reporter.  You're here to titillate your readers. If you don't open your eyes I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
2273,Can we leave this up 'til we move? <BR> Well sure we can leave it up. <BR> Yeah! <BR> Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute. <BR> Okay.
2274,What are you doing? <BR> I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.
2275,I could fuck this icebox I love it so much.  What were you actually doing in New York? <BR> I played piano in a few places. <BR> That's one job you told me a lot of jobs. <BR> A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway I don't want to think about New York. <BR> The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad. <BR> Copy out from here...
2276,You okay -- ? <BR> I dunno ... I keep thinking about him.
2277,You're an asshole Adam. <BR> You're an asshole. <BR> Oh and why am I an asshole? <BR> Multiple reasons. <BR> Name one. <BR> I don't have to...
2278,Hey. <BR> What's wrong with her -- ? <BR> The right side of the engine is running richer than the left. And the scope isn't showing shit... I dunno...
2279,I guess it's too lonely for most folks.  It's time for me to get going. It's been a pleasure meeting you. <BR> Wait won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
2280,What'd the Prosecutor say? <BR> It's not important just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry. <BR> Did you ask for bail?
2281,Go on. <BR> Well when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds I went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune--I happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties or if I'd grabbed a different stack there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story.
2282,And where are we off to Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies? <BR> A simple leak if it's okay with you.
2283,"What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on... <BR> You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh... <BR> Your husband?! <BR> Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there..."
2284,A load if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching thatšs all it is! <BR> John John. <BR> Don't do that! <BR> Dr. Grant Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
2285,Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office? <BR> Mom's orders. <BR> Lawyer here? <BR> I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
2286,Right here Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash. <BR> And we get this money when? <BR> The second the sun hits tomorrow morning. Assuming you have stayed the entire night - and you're still alive of course. Any other questions?
2287,"Sure you don't want any salad? <BR> No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks? <BR> I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but... <BR> She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather... <BR> I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax. <BR> All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential."
2288,Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit? <BR> Uh... actually picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job. <BR> You're the one who's helping *me* Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy too. <BR> Well sure... that's good then.  All I mean is I'm lucky I met you. <BR> I don't think so Homer. *I'm* the lucky one.
2289,I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream isn't it? <BR> I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it. <BR> Okay. <BR> Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
2290,Life gentlemen is wonderful but very dangerous. You must have courage for it then it's wonderful. You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy but I -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life. <BR> Rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns.
2291,1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this? <BR> 
2292,You were-you were sensational. I mean I-you know I-I told yuh that if yuh stuck to it you would be great and-and you know I-I-you- you were sensational. <BR> Yeah well we have the I mean they were just a terrific audience I mean you know it makes it really easy for me because I can be... huh?
2293,Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night? <BR> I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
2294,Quick -- hide in here... <BR> What about you? <BR> Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move! <BR> But where are you going to be? <BR> I'll be right here... I promise.
2295,Would you like to stay for dinner?  There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway you'd have to eat alone. So would I. <BR> That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.
2296,Sure and I'm never gonna die either is this one of your chain letter schemes or do I gotta buy a door to door cosmetic franchise in Northern Arkansas? <BR> No no Dixon my client wants to buy a large large block of stock and needs to spread it around. I'll park some money in your account and if it hits you get a big cut. I'm telling you this is the easiest money you ever made...
2297,Well -- Professor Barnhardt I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world. <BR> He lives here in Washington doesn't he? <BR> Sure. Right near where my mother works. <BR> Where is that? <BR> Department of Commerce. She's a secretary.  They have a man they call the Secretary but he isn't at all. My mother's a real secretary.  Mr. Carpenter -- now can we go see the space ship?
2298,Please excuse me a moment Jeffrey and I'll get to the dishes. <BR> Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes? <BR> Nice of you to offer Jeffrey but certainly not. just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
2299,Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan! <BR> It there's one thing I don't need advice on it's how to drive.

You and your sick friends.  Well make it stop! <BR> Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing? <BR> Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here... <BR> Stop this.  It's not true... <BR> I'm sorry Christ I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ? <BR> Stop it!

2331,Let's talk about Conklin. <BR> What are you after Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it? <BR> I want to know what happened. <BR> What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it couldn't find Bourne couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left. <BR> So you had Conklin killed.  I mean if we're cutting the crap... <BR> I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me I need my pension but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done. <BR> And Bourne? Where's he now? <BR> Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows? <BR> I think I do. We had a deal going down in Berlin last week. During the buy both our Field Agent and the seller were killed. We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didn't go off.  They were killed by Jason Bourne.
2332,That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop. <BR> Because of my coat? <BR> Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you. <BR> Jealous? Of me? <BR> Not you. Your talent.
2333,Hi dad. <BR> Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right? <BR> I'm fine dad. <BR> Well good. Just confirming.

2335,What about that camera? <BR> What camera? <BR> That one -- from the wreck.  You brought it up did you look inside it?
2336,I know just where to go. <BR> Not the drugstore! <BR> Of course not  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me. <BR> The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it? <BR> Nine-thirty ten maybe. <BR> Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up okay?

2339,"You askin' me to clear out now? <BR> You're my brother...You're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to...Ain't that so, Martha?"
2340,Was that all? <BR> This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
2341,Don't give me your life story  just pick up the license. <BR> Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know my girl friend- <BR> Just give me the license please. <BR> Since you put it that way.  It's hard for me to refuse.  ...have a I have a terrific problem with authority you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal.
2342,Mmm ... what are you doing? <BR> Keeping a stiff upper lip? <BR> Is that all?
2343,And?... <BR> I killed them. <BR> Oh shit shit shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?! <BR> Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
2344,Anybody hungry? <BR> What'd you get? <BR> Some bread and...
2345,Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice Lila? <BR> Sam. He said an hour. Or less. <BR> It's been three. <BR> Are we just going to go on sitting here? <BR> He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on okay? <BR> You have an awfully nice habit Sam. <BR> Hundreds! Which one is your pet? <BR> Whenever I start contemplating the panic button your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better. <BR> I feel better when you feel better. <BR> Where's the old highway? <BR> You want to run out there bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours. <BR> Yes. <BR> That wouldn't be a wise thing to do. <BR> Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam I'm going out there! <BR> Arbogast said... <BR> An hour! Or less!
2346,Hey! Oh! <BR> Oh sorry - <BR> What's the matter with you? <BR> Receipts and bills and... everything's here. <BR> Since when do you talk like that? <BR> I'm sorry. <BR> There's a lot of people here. <BR> Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head. <BR> Again! <BR> I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'. <BR> That's enough. <BR> I'm sorry.
2347,Look at me Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true? <BR> Yes.  Yes of course it is. <BR> Then you still love me? <BR> Poppy please just tell me what you want.
2348,I came here from a long distance to stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a room -- a big room -- like you would give General Director Preysing -- I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you give him a little room way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going -- bang -- bang -- bang...  <BR> This gentleman can have my room. <BR> Oh! <BR> Send his bags up to my room. <BR> Oh -- but -- I -- <BR> You're tired. I can see that. <BR> Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill... <BR> You are ill.
2349,Is that really it? <BR> That's really it. <BR> The one she wore on her wedding day? <BR> So I'm told.
2350,Maybe we lost them. <BR> Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
2351,"Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight. <BR> Please, no thanks...  <BR> Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old. <BR> Oh really. <BR> I'll grow old. We'll both die. And we'll never have known each other. That's sad. At least one drink for a dreamer...What's your favorite drink?"
2352,Sorry man but... <BR> Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it. <BR> Any time bro. <BR> Thanks.
2353,Darker.  More...evil? <BR> Yeah...how'd you know? <BR> Call it a guess...
2354,You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight Kringelein. <BR> Oh no stay here Baron -- stay.
2355,Oh.  Ah I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I? <BR> Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine. <BR> Yeah well.  Here Betty.  I just came to give you this.
2356,Those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. They were executed at close range. That one there is a police officer killed by the Mohawks up in Canada more recently. <BR> Jesus... <BR> The agents who have worked out here say its like going into Nam. Unfamiliar terrain foreign language foreign customs... and you never know when you might walk into a few rounds. They hold a lot of old anger for the white man out here.
2357,Esperanza have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union! <BR> All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again and then they'll come and take away the radio... <BR> Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself? <BR> If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
2358,This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles. <BR> Hey if I'm late think what her husband's saying!
2359,We should abort. <BR> NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that Dyson?
2360,Excuse me gentlemen. <BR> I'll take the bank -- All right gentlemen.
2361,Did you tell them?  That we were coming? <BR> Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents? <BR> I know your parents. <BR> I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
2362,We gotta get you to a doctor. <BR> It's okay.  Forget it. <BR> Forget it?  Are you crazy? Let me see it.
2363,"I've caused you some trouble. <BR> Mother...  ...what is the phrase... she isn't herself today""""... I think that's it."" <BR> You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite."
2364,Stop! <BR> What the fuck are you doing he's in there! <BR> They can't get in here!  You said it yourself they'll get in!
2365,Johnny!  Uh you uh... should call first you know?  Hey where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay? <BR> Angelo we gotta talk.
2366,What's this? <BR> The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
2367,Oh I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else. <BR> That's okay. <BR> Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here. <BR> Where is everybody? <BR> We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight. <BR> Why aren't you there? <BR> I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride. <BR> That's too bad. <BR>  <BR> What if I said you? <BR> What if I said goodbye? <BR> Why would you wanna do that? <BR> Why do you always answer a question with a question? <BR> I'm inquisitive. <BR> I'm impatient. Look do you wanna leave a message for someone?
2368, <BR> Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about. <BR> Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street? <BR> Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.  You of course remember Miss Torso.
2369,You know you just do this for shock value. It's not shocking. <BR> When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod? <BR> Geez what time is it?  I have to go feed Big Chief Oberon...You're right I miss him. Wichita that is.  I really want to be with him but I can't bring myself to--Are you a lesbian or are you... <BR> I didn't realize I had to declare a major. <BR> Why do you even like me?
2370,Damn!  This will get him. <BR> Place your bets ladies and gentlemen.
2371,"I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply... <BR> That means closing the beaches."
2372,Maybe I'm missing the obvious but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago. <BR> It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
2373,I get horny as hell for other women.  I mean I fantasize about raping some beautiful woman. <BR> You don't have to tell me this. <BR> I'm just talking man. <BR> Carlos I never raped a woman. <BR> I know. I'm just saying I understand.
2374,Will ya look at her! <BR> I never knowed they was anything like her!
2375,"Got a pen on you? <BR> Why? <BR> There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor. <BR> I don't know if I can do that without a... <BR> I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead. <BR> Maybe we can save August... <BR> Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that? <BR> I was acting in the town's best interests... <BR> The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs. <BR> My kids were on that beach... <BR> Just sign it, Larry."
2376,"What have you got there, Lenny? <BR> We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach."
2377,Have you seen him with someone? <BR> No...  I can just tell. <BR> After all he is my brother and I know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes but I know him pretty well and I really don't think--
2378,"...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard? <BR> No, it was local jurisdiction. <BR> Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around? <BR> No, we just checked the beach... <BR> It wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't a boat propeller, or a coral reef, or Jack the Ripper. It was a shark. It was a shark."
2379,"How can this be? <BR> The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process."
2380,Look what they did to my hand man! <BR> All right I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?
2381,"And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam. <BR> You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris. <BR> I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either."
2382,Long story.  I found this key in the mouth of a wooden Harlequin. <BR> Never mind.
2383,Excuse me? <BR> Well no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school dude. I'm ill-equipped.
2384,ON THE GAS STATION OWNER WHO HAS RETREATED TO HIS COUNTER AND PRODUCES A SHOTGUN AND STARTS TO LOAD IT. <BR> Shoe boy...?  You know you were telling me you wanted Beans?  Remember you were concerned about the Beans...?
2385,"You know what I have to do now, and believe me:  I don't enjoy doing this. <BR> Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!"
2386,What does it mean?  I... I mean we you have other tactics... <BR> We yes. Yes. They they present their side and I get the same chance. To cross-examine... to... to... <BR> Are we going to win?  We have you know other tactics though... <BR> Yes.
2387,I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself. <BR> What?
2388,"This will get me a second term.  Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history.  I, Nixon, was born to do this. <BR> Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret. <BR> This is a major coup, gentlemen -- our own State Department doesn't even know.  And if it leaks out of here tonight ..."
2389,"Hey, Betty. Are you okay? <BR> I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy? <BR> Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few... <BR> Make sure it's elevated... <BR> Uh-huh. <BR> You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem..."
2390,Stupid cunt! <BR> Caesar stop acting like an asshole and think -- <BR> Don't try to tell me what to do. <BR> You need the money just like we do. <BR> Shut up Violet. <BR> Let us go and we'll make a deal.
2391,--has any of them got an ax?-- <BR> --political personal sexual anything at all against Mitchell?--
2392,Do you remember where you lived? <BR> It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean? <BR> What about... now? <BR> With them? <BR> Yes. <BR> We move.  Place to place.
2393,Yo you got any weed around here? <BR> Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.
2394,I can do it Captain. <BR> Thanks Dewey but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off...
2395,My king will pay any ransom you ask. <BR> Your king?  Ah yes of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work. <BR> God defeated the English not me. <BR> And God who allowed you to be caught?
2396,You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ? <BR> Sure man -- <BR> She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand. Give 'em sixty ...
2397,I never knew it could be like this. <BR> Thank you. <BR> They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts. <BR> Mineral baths - now really! <BR> Where did you learn to kiss like that? <BR> Oh you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
2398,I made the plume from a quail feather. <BR> Much more colorful than the ones we wear.  And of course less dented.
2399,This was a Selective Operations Unit Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ -- <BR> -- if they mine uranium there these people will have no place left to go... <BR> We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters Ray. I don't know about uranium I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over. <BR> We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it? <BR> No. We neutralized enemies of the United States. Anti-American radicals who have killed federal officers out here!
2400,His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones. <BR> Why's he called 'Invisible'? <BR> You'll find out.
2401,Well? <BR> Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted. <BR> Not very encouraging. <BR> On the contrary!  It absolutely proves what I have always felt. We are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits.  We are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth.  We must continue the search.
2402,All you have to remember is first find the common denominator -- then subtract. <BR> Thanks Mr. Carpenter. <BR> I'll say goodnight again.
2403,A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous. <BR> Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
2404,Yes... And in doing so you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming. <BR> And I thought my mother was the master of guilt.  Geez Louise. <BR> SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!! <BR> Oh God... What have I done...
2405,You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back. <BR> Fuck you too. <BR> Get in line!
2406,"It's three feet deep, Martin <BR> Michael! Come inside! <BR> It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again. <BR> I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself..."
2407,That's right.  Will break through. <BR> I get ah - - <BR> I know it's very exciting. <BR> And scary. <BR> And scary. <BR> When people try to control things that it's out of their power - - <BR> It's anti-nature. <BR> Anti-nature.
2408,Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties... <BR> You've talked enough today you're hoarse now.
2409,What say Epps? You up for some roasted albatross? <BR> Why not?
2410,Get them out of here! <BR> Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps but not in the royal bedchamber! <BR> Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me? <BR> Gave you?  Well now I wouldn't quite put it like that... <BR> So how would you put it? <BR>  <BR> Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance! <BR> Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
2411,Yah real good. How you doin'? <BR> Pretty good Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone. <BR> Yah it's pretty darned busy here but that's the way we like it. <BR> That's for sure. Now I just need on these last these financing documents you sent us I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here so I - <BR> But I already got the it's okay the loans are in place I already got the the what the - <BR> Yeah the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars you got the money last month. <BR> Yah so we're all set. <BR> Yeah but the vehicles you were borrowing on I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me - <BR> But the deal's already done I already got the money - <BR> Yeah but we have an audit here I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money that they really exist. <BR> Yah well they exist all right. <BR> I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me - <BR> Well but see I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy - <BR> No fax is no good that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing - <BR> Yah okay I'll have my girl send you over a copy then. <BR> Okay because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles then I gotta call back that money - <BR> Yah how much money was that? <BR> Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on. <BR> Yah no problem I'll just fax that over to ya then. <BR> No no fax is - <BR> I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya. <BR> Okay. <BR> Okay real good then.
2412,Up for a celebration dinner? <BR> Are you asking me on a date? <BR> As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy. <BR> Then forget it. Besides I have an early class tomorrow. <BR> So Friday at eight?
2413,Please O'Brien don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want! <BR> Yeah I'm going to finish what you started --
2414,I didn't think it would. She's calling herself L.A. Joan this- week. Last week it was Dakota. Guess if you have to change your name a state's as good as anything. <BR> She sure sings nice. <BR> My wife and I think so but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do pick or sing? <BR> Oh... a little of both. Just thought I'd look around at Nashville for a while.
2415,I'm sorry Bruce I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation. <BR> Vicki if I say anything cryptic or... ambiguous I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.
2416,That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat she needs to work on her spin control. <BR> 
2417,No we don't!  You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war so why don't you?  My brother died over there last November.  Why?  What good was his death? <BR> I know.  I know.  I've seen a lot of kids die too in World War II.
2418,Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot. <BR> What do I do with my free afternoon walk you to the airport? <BR> We could laze around here a while longer. <BR> Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in but when your time's up...  Sam I hate having to be with you in a place like this. <BR> I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it... <BR> When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately. <BR> You sure talk like a girl who's been married. <BR> Sam! <BR> I'm sorry Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it. <BR> I've lost my girlish laughter. <BR> The only girlish thing you have lost. <BR> Sam. This is the last time. <BR> For what? <BR> This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come. <BR> Okay. What do we do instead write each other lurid love letters? <BR> I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl. <BR> And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy!  <BR> It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here... <BR> You can't laugh at it huh? <BR> Can you? <BR> Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw but...
2419,Did you have to use that much explosive? <BR> I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
2420,This man -- did you see him? <BR> No. Her husband she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
2421,Ahh shit.  We're pretty much tapped out.  I'm getting denied access all over the place... <BR> It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check? <BR> Shit we just started.  But I better log out of this.
2422,You need to say a bit more than that! <BR> Oh... er... yes...
2423,I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror. <BR> When I traveled through Asia this summer I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour for updates. <BR> What about my play?
2424,...uh you know I just wanted to talk to you a minute. <BR> Well... <BR> ...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is. <BR> Yeah? Well listen Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me. <BR> She's there with you?  She's there with you? <BR> Yeah she's here. <BR> I'll be right there.
2425,Why did you set me up? <BR> I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone. <BR> Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that? <BR> I had to get away!  My life was in danger! <BR> Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy? <BR> No.  A witness. <BR> What exactly did you see? <BR> Six months ago a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note you may have heard of it... <BR> No but I'm listening. <BR> I was there and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened. <BR> Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room? <BR> Yeah...they did.  One girl...
2426,Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville. <BR> I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to. <BR> Texas is a big state. <BR> I can handle it. <BR> I'll bet you can. <BR> You'd do the same for me wouldn't you Doc?  If I was caught wouldn't you?
2427,"I thought Steve had talked to you? <BR> Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But -- do me a favor? -- none of this DEMONS crap."
2428,And that's it? <BR> If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  <u>Take it</u>.
2429,This is the best we're gonna do. <BR> It'll have to do.
2430,I called Connie and she said not to worry She'll fill in for you. <BR> I see.
2431,Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans. <BR> Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain. <BR> Well he seems to have bought Kissinger. <BR> The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder. <BR> You're the one who should be in politics John.  You're tougher than I am.  You never crack. <BR> That'll be the day. <BR> Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit. <BR> Make some money Dick prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
2432,A man is assaulting a woman at one two five west ninth street. Second floor rear. Make it fast. <BR> Your name? <BR> L. B. Jefferies. <BR> Phone number? <BR> Chelsea 2-5598. <BR> Two minutes.
2433,Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job. <BR> And she didn't?
2434,Well Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman. <BR> That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
2435,This is private property. The public footpath is back to the left of the bridge. <BR> How are you Rhian?
2436,Good evening ... Can we pass? <BR> It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible. <BR> But it's not even midnight yet! <BR> It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight. <BR> Please we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah. <BR> I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Tonight is out of the question.
2437,Richard ... come with me would you ... <BR> Why me?
2438,That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction. <BR> None of that's true? <BR> Well Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead. <BR> So what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people? <BR> My job is not to determine his guilt or innocence. That's up to the jury. My job is defend him.
2439,Lisa please! <BR> There's nothing to see. <BR> There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering family fights mysterious trips at night knives saws rope -- and since last evening not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing! <BR> Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know and I don't care. Lots of people have saws knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag and men hate them and trouble starts -- but very very very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking. <BR> It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is? <BR> You could see all the things he did couldn't you? <BR> What are you getting at? <BR> You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up and walked along the corridor and the streets and the backyard? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Jeff do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them? <BR> That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant. <BR> And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.
2440,You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions. <BR> Well we can only guess about that Edna. They *are* against the law.
2441,Somebody was serious about doing this guy that's for sure. <BR> Ray.
2442,You're lying. <BR> The hell I am. <BR> Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself. <BR> I never said that. <BR>  <BR> I didn't mean it that way. <BR> It's okay Professor Tripp. Carrie Howard the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on and the longer they go on the more annoying they become until finally you just want to grab something heavy and -- <BR> Shut up James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have okay?
2443,Saved me?  You don't even know me. You used me Caesar just like I used you.  All part of the business. <BR> You betrayed me! <BR> You murdered Gino! <BR> I had to.  You made me. <BR> Bullshit you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you. <BR> Shut up!
2444,Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor. <BR> Don you talk about honor but you mean vendetta. Killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
2445,"I say NO! <BR> Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do..."
2446,Breathe that air Miss Teschmacher. <BR> I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
2447,We never met. That's why. <BR> Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve.
2448,Sheriff I don't... <BR> C'mon Betty open up! I got some questions for you about...
2449,The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being. <BR> Got it. <BR> The problem is the by-product created by the process. <BR> The waste.
2450,Well I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair. <BR> How did you find out? <BR> My husband. <BR> He told you?
2451,Damn this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it? <BR> Tenth floor. <BR> Very funny.
2452,Have you ever omitted telling me. things before? <BR> No. <BR> Then why? <BR> I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you. <BR> Can you quit? <BR> No. <BR> And... where are things? <BR> Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.
2453,What do you think it is? <BR> What do you think it is? <BR> It couldn't be. <BR> It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone. <BR> Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson you'd be out to here! <BR> I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him. <BR> But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too.
2454,Well I guess you caught me at a weak moment. <BR> You'll have to speak up.
2455,I don't like talking bad about the dead but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes she of all people was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry. <BR> What do you mean? <BR> If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed it would have been me. <BR> Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now without a doubt that your granddaughter is alive and did not kill Del Sizemore.
2456,How did you break into my office Deborah? Ladies of your standing dont learn to pick locks between shopping trips.  Come on Deborah! Acting dumb doesnt suit you! Who knew Id found dirt on your brother huh? Who knew it was in an envelope? Taking me for dead whod want to make sure it didnt fall into the wrong hands? <BR> Youre mad... <BR> Ive had a long and unpleasant day. Im tired and Im angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leons boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why havent you told your husband where he is since reading my note eh? <BR> Why... I dont know what youre talking about. <BR> You know hed have had him killed dont you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married? <BR> Have you finished? <BR> When did you learn about his taste for kids huh? On your honeymoon? Or was it later when bitterness set in and you turned against your beloved but weak little brother? How did you find out? Did he confess? Try to convert you perhaps? Or was it womans intuition? Or just the way he fucked you?
2457,Welcome to the Monkey House has been a seminal influence on me -- hey Benjamin -- give it a try? This stuff will make some sense out of those larger questions. <BR> Thanks for the advice Dave.
2458,I fucked up Frankie. I fucked up good this time. Should have never started with this fuckin' broad. <BR> Take it easy. What could you do? I mean she threw herself at you right? <BR> I'm in a bad fuckin' spot here. You know that? Bad fuckin' spot.
2459,You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work Sebastian. <BR> It works a little. <BR> No it doesn't. I see right through you. <BR> You do? <BR> I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble. <BR> Well you don't have to get nasty about it.
2460,Something like that. <BR> That was terrific. <BR> You should hear the bird. <BR> You live around here? <BR> Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too? <BR> Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher. <BR> Were you watching me? <BR> Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly. <BR> I have to go. <BR> Do you come here often? <BR> My daddy likes me home before dark. <BR> It's good to listen to your daddy.
2461,This is our oil from our estates? <BR> I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
2462,What are you doing? <BR> Now they only have three rockets left.
2463,Don't do it Ted. Don't do it. <BR> Any time any day a man can completely reinvent himself.
2464,Daphne - <BR> He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything. <BR> You'll forget him Sugar. <BR> How can I?  No matter where I go there'll always be a Shell station on the corner.  I'll bring this back when it's empty.
2465,Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you. <BR> Why? <BR> Because I want to.  I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator.
2466,Are you all right? <BR> Yes of course. Why wouldn't I be?
2467,Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?! <BR> Hey these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon they're not lying down on the job.
2468,Did you take anything out of those pants? <BR> Oh no sir! <BR> What are you doing fooling around in here? <BR> Miss Schuyler - I mean Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning sir.
2469,Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this? <BR> Nope there's no way. <BR> Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like? <BR> Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is. <BR> In other words I'm fucked. <BR> In so many words yes. <BR> It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care. <BR> I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.
2470,What? <BR> She starts sniffing me. <BR> Oh my God...  You're blushing. <BR> It's still a very sensitive memory for me. <BR> Then what happened? <BR> We got engaged. <BR> Oh you!
2471,You need to come home! <BR> I can see that... <BR> The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won! <BR> If you win you know you have to stay.  It's the losers who get to go home.  Besides I'm not so sure it is over.  Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines.
2472,You got the money? <BR> Right here. <BR> Well don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars you lost it. <BR> Well that just happened that time. <BR> Well it better not happen again.
2473,Let's talk to whoever can get this over with... <BR> Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.
2474,What?  The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword. <BR> I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it?
2475,The Ghost advances on the young girl grabbing her pulling her to him raising high a long hunting knife. The young girl is helpless... <BR> Maureen looks at Phil confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
2476,There's a strange man in our bathroom and he just raped Caitlin! <BR> Oh God...
2477,You were very different yesterday. <BR> Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
2478,Turn it off. <BR> What? <BR> You know what. The radio.
2479,Please sit down. I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here. I've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers. <BR> ...that's all right. <BR> I was telling your wife we have a very good case here.
2480,Damn it! You cant fucking walk away from this! <BR> Its up to you whether they walk or not.
2481,What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested. <BR> But...you...
2482,You and that damned garden. <BR> Yeah but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her? <BR> I surrender -- <BR> Besides if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done. <BR> It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much. <BR> Well it's not supposed to be done anyway.
2483,In quite a hurry. <BR> Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over... <BR> You slept here all night? <BR> Yes. As I said I couldn't keep my eyes... <BR> There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean just to be safe... <BR> I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws? <BR> No m'am. <BR> Then I'm free to go...? <BR> Is anything wrong? <BR> Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong? <BR> Frankly yes. <BR> Please... I'd like to go... <BR> Is there? <BR> Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time... <BR> Now wait just a moment! Turn your motor off please.
2484,You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself? <BR> Nicky I did - <BR> Is that what you did? <BR> I did - I didn't - <BR> Tell him to go fuck himself? You fuckin' hick!  Fuckin'...
2485,Interesting. <BR> I see. <BR> Yeah well that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're here you see.
2486,The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force-- <BR> Yes. <BR> Would such a demonstration be possible before the meeting? <BR> Yes -- of course. <BR> Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet. <BR> That can easily be arranged. <BR> I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything. <BR> Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something. <BR> Maybe a little demonstration. <BR> Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
2487, <BR> Jack we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold .. <BR> And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ... <BR> It's nobody's fault Jack.  It's change -- which is a fact of history. Even that old cocksucker Hoover's dead.  Things change.
2488,We're carrying weight. <BR> We'll take your supercargo.
2489,--I'm not your source on that-- <BR> --it's gotta be Haldeman--someone from the White House had to be involved--
2490,I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood. <BR> You were not. <BR> I was not.
2491,Who are you? <BR> I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering is your husband here? <BR> He's asleep. We were up very late. <BR> Well yes I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father Mrs. Twombley. <BR> Mrs. Gordon. Thank you. <BR> Well yeah I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer. <BR> Something about my father? <BR> Oh no. No it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal. <BR> Can't it wait then?
2492,That's a nasty scratch on your neck. <BR> I have a passionate girlfriend. <BR> What's with the boxes? <BR> You're a cop. Figure it out. <BR> I'd say you're moving. <BR> It's a free country isn't it?
2493,Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore. <BR> Who's driving her? <BR> I don't know. <BR> This paint sucks. The white shows through.
2494,But why? What's the point? <BR> A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor. <BR> And I suppose you're the knight. <BR> The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen. <BR> That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know.
2495,Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim. <BR> Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive? <BR> Oh yeah he's alive.  Technically. <BR> And you have him? <BR> We lost him.
2496, <BR> Uh...Didn't we <u>do</u> this? <BR> Never quit a winner.
2497,Blue square for Belvedere Ohio where the Bimmel girl was abducted. Blue triangle where her body was found - down here in Missouri. Same marks for the other four girls in different colors. This new one today... washed up here.  Elk River in West Virginia about six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies. <BR> There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all? <BR> Good idea but he thought of it too. We've run simulations using different vectors and the best dates we can assign. You put it all in the computer and smoke comes out. No this one is different. This one has seen us coming...
2498,How long do you live?  I mean last? <BR> A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
2499,Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up... <BR> She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims I might add. <BR> I don't believe it.  Do you?
2500,There were two.  Not one.  But two. <BR> I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry. <BR> Anne... The night we had together... I always wanted more.  But that one it was enough.  Enough to make me love you forever.  I want you to remember that... and go on.  As strong as you are now.  No matter what happens.
2501,Then why didn't they take it. <BR> Probably didn't have time.
2502,"You've been back to Dallas? <BR> Yes. <BR> Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove -- <BR> That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained -- <BR> -- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully -- <BR> Yes. I know."
2503,Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase! <BR> You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here. <BR> Fine.  I'm takin' Amy. <BR> You're not takin' Amy. <BR> I am. I'm wakin' her up right now. <BR> You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.
2504,I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone! <BR> Why didn't you give a warning signal? <BR> Your foreman says that's a foreman's job.
2505,Well I -- it's just -- I don't know a User I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you... <BR> Now get this straight pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece <BR> But-what if I can't...? <BR> You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
2506,So what's this about Dick? <BR> It's me or Wallace Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support. <BR> 
2507,Okay ramblers let's get to rambling. Wait a minute who didn't throw in? <BR> Mr. Pink. <BR> Mr. Pink?  Why? <BR> He don't tip. <BR> He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why? <BR> He don't believe in it. <BR> He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it? <BR> Nope. <BR> Shut up!  Cough up the buck ya cheap bastard I paid for your goddamn breakfast.
2508,Can't we just sort of keep things status quo? <BR> Without any future?
2509,Funny couple ain't they? <BR> Yeah. <BR> If you ask me I don't believe they're married. <BR> They're married all right. I just seen the license. <BR> They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket on a night like this. <BR> Yeah? <BR> What do you reckon that's for? <BR> Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet. <BR> A trumpet? <BR> Yeah. You know one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it. <BR> But what in the world do they want a trumpet for? <BR> I dunno.
2510,Forget it. That's past. <BR> No matter what you say to me Salvatore you are my bambino.
2511,Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway? <BR> Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
2512,Thank you. <BR> You're not wimping out on us Goodspeed. <BR> 
2513,I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART <BR> YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE <BR> YOU LOST YOUR BABY WHEN YOU LOST YOUR BALLS YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND YOU'VE LOST YOUR GRIP SO SAY BYE-BYE
2514,Torque wrench please. <BR> Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad. <BR> You will. <BR> Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm like 45 I think I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night but she still loves him I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.
2515,Nice club Mr. Gekko... <BR> Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people! <BR> Uh Mr. Gekko we took a little loss today. We got stopped out on Tarafly...  ...about 50 thousand.
2516,Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun. <BR> They grow outside don't they? <BR> Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships. <BR> You going to take me on a nature walk? <BR> Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work but instead of getting off at your normal stop for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus Walter? <BR> I fell asleep.
2517,If you promise not to snap my head off I'd like to thank you. <BR> Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
2518,We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes. <BR> We want you to go to college find a career you love marry a nice girl from a nice family and live happily ever after.
2519,You'll excuse me gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon. <BR> Good evening Mr. Blaine.
2520,--what do you think?-- <BR> --Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant. <BR> Maybe a political operative of some sort-- <BR> --a spy you mean? <BR> It makes sense; Hunt worked for the C.I.A. and the White House was paranoid about Teddy Kennedy.
2521,Look while we're talking we could be inside you know that? <BR> Hey can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody 'cause I get embarrassed. <BR> Alright. All right all right so whatta you wanna do? <BR> I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity. <BR> Oh come on we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis. <BR> Well I'm sorry I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish 'cause- 'cause I'm anal. <BR> H'h that's a polite word for what you are.
2522,I need the police. <BR> Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
2523,Kyle don't go! <BR> There's not much time left in the world Sarah.
2524,And what's that? <BR> S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb. <BR> He just let it explode. <BR> What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building? <BR> The Federal Building was too well guarded. <BR> No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing...
2525,Hi it's me. I'm still here. <BR> I'm so glad. <BR> I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis. <BR> And you will.  But not now. <BR> I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning. <BR> I told you he had to go out on a case.
2526,...uh-uh-uh - I'm not gonna ask you where you are just please put Amy on a plane. Just put her on right away any plane to get her here right away... <BR> ...please. That's all I'm askin' you. <BR> Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself. <BR> What do you mean? <BR> What I mean is you think if uh do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me? <BR> Uh  I don't know. I gotta tell you I don't know. <BR> Right. <BR> I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up. <BR> What about the money? Uh where's the box? <BR> I gotta tell ya... <BR> ...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money. <BR> What's it... <BR> ...under? <BR> Pretty serious. <BR> How serious? <BR> It's uh it's under twenty-five. <BR> It's under... <BR> ...twenty-five thousand? <BR> Yeah. <BR> And... <BR> ...the rest of the two million is still there? <BR> Yeah yeah I got the rest. <BR> Okay no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five.  That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't. <BR> Okay? <BR> All right...
2527,Thanks so much for inviting me tonight. <BR> Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest. <BR> There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest. <BR> I'm sure we've met.
2528,I had my kid brother Dominick run it for me. <BR> Fuckers!
2529,It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people. <BR> I'm happy I amuse you. <BR> Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him.  <BR> Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator!  <BR> Happy to be alive under any circumstances--is that your point?
2530,Stop it. <BR> Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
2531,The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed not the wheelchair. <BR> How did you know! <BR> Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours. <BR> I was. <BR> What'll you do if one of them catches you? <BR> Depends one which one.
2532,....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day - <BR> Twenty-four. <BR> Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore if you will reveal yourself your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah this Earth...this world you live in Kal-El...  Resist its temptations its rewards especially its political system. <BR> There are none of them any good anyway. <BR> And it is forbidden for you to interfere with human history. All you can do Kal-El even now that you have...found yourself...is help them to evolve. Set an example. Show them they must strive towards the light. And... remember us...
2533,Look at you. <BR> What? <BR> Well usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know like something's driving you.  See it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy. <BR> I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling. <BR> You don't have to.
2534,What do you think has happened to your son Mrs Spitz? <BR> You wouldnt be here if I knew Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now. <BR> How did you do that Mrs Spitz? <BR> Do what Mr Lombard? <BR> Check with your sons bank. Banks dont usually give out information about their customers. <BR> I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account. <BR> I didnt mean to imply you did Mrs Spitz. <BR> Then you should not have sought an explanation. <BR> I presume you checked your sons apartment... <BR> Yesterday. It all looked normal. <BR> Did you look for his passport driving licence? <BR> Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport I do not know where he keeps it. <BR> So he could have decided to go on a trip... <BR> He could indeed Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it. <BR> Then why arent you asking the police to look for your son Mrs Spitz?
2535,That the planet blew up on May 23 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo? <BR> He's thirty-five years old. <BR> You're a great architect Albert. <BR> Thank you. <BR> Otherwise you're a Mongoloid idiot.  It's reasonable to assume that fragments of the planet were shot out into space by the force of the explosion and  --
2536,How about over there...that empty memory? <BR> No good...they might block off the old chip.  This way.
2537,Who is he? <BR> One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
2538,If we can't stay in the rex's territory we have to move tonight. <BR> Move where?  Our boat's not coming for two days your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --
2539,What the fuck was that about? <BR> You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks -- <BR> I got news for you Bobby he don't give a shit. <BR> Bullshit. <BR> You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing. <BR> No more.
2540,She got a little poison oak and started screaming for assisted suicide. <BR> Be nice. Her father died in that TWA flight the government shot down...You know I'm going to be in the city next week. My mom says it's okay that I stay overnight at your dorm...It'll be nice to see you in                          ] a different shirt.                                          ] ] WICHITA                                            ] Oh I didn't tell you. I wear this                          ] all year round. The chicks dig it...                        ]
2541,Hi. I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post and I hate to bother you at home-- <BR> --I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription. <BR> No I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect. <BR> The what to what? <BR> You work there Miss Abbott. <BR> I'm not Miss Abbott.
2542,Hey you know what's gonna get us out of here?  It's not a map Max. It's our balls. You know what I mean...  ...I gotta get laid man I don't know 'bout you guys but if I don't get it on soon I'm... I'm not gonna make it. <BR> Shit. <BR> Billy?
2543,Listen. Maybe I should go... <BR> I've been a Little dyspeptic. <BR> I want to get the dog off my bed. <BR> But I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong you go right off...
2544,What about you Mrs De Moraes? <BR> I have too much money to work Mr Lombard. <BR> Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan? <BR> Perhaps it wasnt so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct as someone in your line of work ought to know. <BR> Was it cash Mr De Moraes?  The Ł1000. You gave it to him in cash?
2545,What now? <BR> We could call for help. <BR> And get a bunch of fools sniffin' around here?
2546,You always carry a gun with you? <BR> No. <BR> Only on dates?
2547,Nein dies ein ist mein.  This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly. <BR> That was Gary Cooper shithead... <BR> No more jokes drop it or she gets it between the eyes! <BR> Whoa Hans now you're the cowboy? <BR> 'Yippe-ki-yea mother fucker'?  Now you are fucked.
2548,You'd better fix this Ray!!! <BR> I'll speak to someone. <BR> And you'd better speak to someone too ... or find yourself another client!! This smells like a set-up to me!  And by the way Ray I don't know who these guys are kidding but every foot of film I've shot is in a vault at the lab that only I can access. No one's getting that film!!
2549,Yeah I took 'em. So what? <BR> How did she...  ...happen to have them?
2550,So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner. <BR> You know who I am? <BR> Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away. <BR> I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers. <BR> You might say I'm at the top of their shit list. <BR> Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day. <BR> What's with the bad air between you two Mr. Kastle? <BR> It's nothing just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?
2551,Does he have to stay here over night? <BR> Absolutely.
2552,Why the hell couldnt you divorce the man? <BR> You wouldnt understand.
2553,Blood temperature feels like high eighties. <BR> Wu?
2554,Jesus Christ Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God it's all part of some case isn't it? <BR> Tyler put the gun down. <BR> You tell me the fucking truth Johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash?  DID THEY?!
2555,Tom you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world is involved! <BR> I don't care about the rest of the world!
2556,They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and before that it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split. <BR> So you never knew your mother? <BR> I guess not. But as of now I never knew either. <BR> I'm sorry. <BR> Yeah. [Beat] How about you? <BR> Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young. <BR> How? <BR> She fucked herself up day after day and then one day she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
2557,"You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you. <BR> Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters. <BR> And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent Mulder."
2558,This is tactically dangerous. <BR> Drive faster. <BR> The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house. <BR> I don't care.  We've gotta stop her. <BR> Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war. <BR> I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?!  Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
2559,Heavy lifting can only help you at this point. <BR> That is sick man.
2560,Because they're not Americans. <BR> Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America! <BR> Why would they?!  Who the hell's Sulzberger anyway?  Their parents are gold traders from Eastern Europe. They buy things.  They come to Jew York City and they buy up things.  One of the things they buy is the New York Times.  And you know what?  Be proud because they'll never trust you sir because we speak for the average American.
2561,Thanks for getting rid of those flowers. <BR> Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers? <BR> It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him. <BR> I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
2562,You gentlemen feel you have to do this now? <BR> Now's the perfect time.  The animal just fed so it won't stalk us for food.  Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry.
2563,Do you remember where it is? <BR> What? <BR> Where you lived with them.
2564,Yeah. <BR> Well I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know but it's gotten-it's so dirty now. <BR> Yeah.
2565,No Cease.  There was no answer. <BR> I thought I heard someone knocking. <BR> I was buzzing I was knocking but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower. <BR> Yeah it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino she was trying to help me relax. <BR> That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax. <BR> Shit Mick come on in let me get you a drink.  Sit down Lou.
2566,Hi. You didn't answer your beeper. <BR> I threw it away. <BR> You threw it away? <BR> Look I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to but it's just - You know I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore.  Where's Amy? <BR> I put her to bed. <BR> Oh.  I got your cigarettes.
2567,I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body. <BR> Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.
2568,My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu. <BR> Just Klaatu. <BR> The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel-- <BR> Sit down Mr. Harley.
2569,It's too late. <BR> Too late for what? <BR> They only dump the water at night.
2570,His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue tail between his legs wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men those two and if they ever started to tangle you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back. <BR> You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind? <BR> Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway and before he could get her back to where she lived the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did if you ask me. <BR> Jesus. <BR> Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did. <BR> It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years. <BR> No I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead. <BR> And he's never tried to get in touch with his son? <BR> Henry told Cyrus he'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again. When Henry makes a threat like that people tend to take him seriously.
2571,Oh look I mean it's kind of the last thing... I mean I'd really like to but... things at home are kind of sensitive so I couldn't really er ... <BR> I thought perhaps as Vice-President and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ... <BR> on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs ... Yes.  Great news.  Fabulous.  Triumphant.  Course it might need a little smoothing over.  When's he due?
2572,If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you. <BR> Not if you're more hungry than scared. <BR> All right. You win. Let's forget it. <BR> I can't forget it. I'm still hungry. <BR> Holy Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with you!
2573,Where the hell are we going to go then Billy Jack!? <BR> There's a bomb shelter over in Durant by the IGA on First. You all know where that is?
2574,Imagine my surprise when I got your call Max. <BR> Yeah. I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment. You know I heard high-pitched squealing.
2575,Rita... I know what you're doing. <BR> What ... I..HAVE... to do. <BR> I know what you have to do but let me do it.
2576,What are you lookin' at? <BR> Nothing. <BR> Don't look at me Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.  You like me?.
2577,The cure's not working Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital. <BR> Don't worry kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.
2578,I was wrong about you Blade. You were never one of us. You're a traitor to your race. <BR> Get away from him!
2579,He wasn't lying about Marco:  He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich and I found his body upstairs.  And his bag is missing. <BR> He had the detonators!  Theo?  Theo!
2580,Done much shooting with that rifle yet? <BR> Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten kid there's another hundred bucks in it. <BR> If you get it? <BR> Yeah. <BR> You might not kill it. <BR> You think so. <BR> You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it. <BR> You take care of your end kid I'll take care of mine. <BR> Mmm. <BR> You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer a dead one not a cripple or whatthefuck. <BR> I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time. <BR> And you'll get your extra hundred bucks. <BR> Wonderful!
2581,They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that? <BR> You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that. <BR> And what if I couldn't do that? <BR> Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.
2582,Flynn...  Where's Ram? <BR> I'm sorry Tron... he's... he didn't make it.
2583,No sir you did not. <BR> Damn right.  And there's still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe ... That's the point isn't it?  They wanna believe in the President.
2584,Oh Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you. <BR> I feel naked without it.
2585,Why you got a customer? <BR> The White House. <BR> You're fucking me. <BR> We're gonna be plumbers Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak. <BR> Who we working for? <BR> A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
2586,You don't miss it? <BR> I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys. <BR> But you had so much *responsibility*. <BR> I never *asked* for any responsibility. <BR> Just a little privacy.
2587,What's she doin' now? <BR> She hooked up with Fed McGar they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So explain the telegram. <BR> Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's. <BR> Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice. <BR> Not a problem got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice? <BR> He's doin' twenty years in Susanville. <BR> What for? <BR> Bad luck. What's the exposure like? <BR> Two minutes tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight during business hours dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd. <BR> How many employees? <BR> Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont. <BR> No they're not.
2588,You're totally full of shit aren't you? <BR> You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
2589,Were you in Nam? <BR> Airborne. That's where they used to get us agents from. Now we get 'em from Carnegie-Melon Ivy League. Accountants and computer whiz-kids. Yuppies with guns.  That's scary shit.
2590,How do you feel? <BR> I'm okay. But it's nice to be home. <BR> Four nights. How did you sleep? <BR> We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
2591,You've... memorized...? <BR> What was the end page?
2592,Or rather do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto? <BR> Are those the only two possibilities?  You wanna French fry? <BR> OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work? <BR> Should there be? <BR> Tell me about it. What are you angry about?
2593,Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it Jerry. Now d'you want anyone at home with you until they call? <BR> No I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me they were real clear. <BR> Yah.
2594,I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again... <BR> But what became of your lamb?  Clarice...?
2595,No. I'm OK. Thanks. <BR> You're OK? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Because gee you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all... <BR> Yeah well it's been a bad day. <BR> A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
2596,Hey man. <BR> Oh hey Vijay. <BR> Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant? <BR> Yup. <BR> Just like our moms and teachers! <BR> Yup. <BR> Did you hear it's yours? <BR> Yup. <BR> What a trip man. <BR> I don't really know anything about it. <BR> You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now. <BR> I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly. <BR> Me neither. But I'm going to stop wearing underpants in order to raise my sperm count. See you.
2597,Why are you doing this to me? <BR> Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
2598,...Who's Jean? <BR> My wife! What the - how's - <BR> Oh Jean's okay. But there's three people up in Brainerd who aren't so okay I'll tell ya that. <BR> What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here - <BR> Blood has been shed Jerry.
2599,You're not looking too good. <BR> Whoa I just...I just...
2600,Come on. <BR> What's the matter? <BR> What do you mean 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut. <BR> What money? I've seen you stealing from me. <BR> What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end. <BR> Ginger I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me. <BR> Don't give me that shit. I want my money. <BR> That bag's full of fuckin' chips you <BR> What do you mean 'stole'? I didn't steal anything from you.
2601,We're asking you to go to prison. <BR> But I've never served a day. <BR> If it wasn't important for everybody we wouldn't ask. We got friends in Philly. They can send you up for a couple months on a weapons charge. <BR> Awwh Charlie. <BR> Minimum security. You'll have everything but broads.
2602,I have the letters right here. <BR> Tell me when we searched the place where were they? <BR> Sam's piano. <BR> Serves me right for not being musical.
2603,Oh Jesus oh Jesus.  Man I knew we shouldn't have gone.  I tried to tell you.  I tried to tell you.  You guys made me come!  You made me come!! <BR> Will you shut up?  You sound like my fucking sister.
2604,What I don't understand is how you got here. <BR> I assure you there's nothing mysterious involved. <BR> Probably you're right but a little while ago I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars. <BR> So? <BR> Well they never would have been assigned if anyone had known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel. And that could only mean the burglars didn't arrange for their own counsel--they never even made a phone call.  So if they didn't ask for you to be here how did you know to come?
2605,Can you walk? Puedes caminar? <BR> She say she in great pain. <BR> Thanks for the translation.  What's your name? Nombre?
2606,What's that? <BR> It's just my heart. <BR> What you got a picture of your heart for?
2607,Rick I'm sick and tired of having you -- <BR> -- Sacha call a cab.
2608,Monsieur Laszlo is it not? <BR> Yes. <BR> I am Captain Renault Prefect of Police. <BR> Yes. What is it you want? <BR> Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor. <BR> Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me Captain but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund? <BR> I was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca. That was a gross understatement.
2609,Shh. Come on it's gonna be OK. <BR> That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore. <BR> Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out. <BR> I only did it once and...
2610,Jake what're you doin' here? <BR> Nothin' Morty it's my lunch hour I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
2611,Waste not Master Hood -- that was $20 for the bag. <BR> Man Francis you are one drug addled elitist freak and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation you know like in the fields. <BR> Paul cancel your mental appointments baby. What are you like still stoned from last night? <BR> I gotta get to English class.
2612,What on Earth are they doing? <BR> Who am I David Blane?
2613,It's desperate that I talk to her. <BR> I've already told you she's not home. <BR> Well please leave a message that I called. <BR> I'll do that.
2614,--there had to be a White House overseer-- <BR> --Colson.
2615,You've got it all right here you know. It's just as beautiful as any other place I've seen. God it knocks me out. <BR> What? <BR>  <BR> Umm I don't know. I can look it up. <BR> I'd appreciate it. I like knowing who I'm stealing from. If you can't create art I think the least you can do is recognize it around you don't you think? There is...  ... so much beauty.
2616,Shit I don't have her number.  She was never interviewed.  She took off right after the accident. <BR> How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state. <BR> Hey I'm a police officer remember?
2617,Considering you brought my mother into it $71.50. <BR> Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
2618,You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth-- <BR> Who paid the bill? <BR> It's a company... MPG Capital.
2619,I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing. <BR> And what would'st I gain from this bargain? <BR> Your life. <BR> How?
2620,What the fuck is this? <BR> What's it look like to you? <BR> It looks like dwarf bowling.
2621,What are you doing out here? <BR> I might ask you the same question. <BR> I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore... <BR> And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of? <BR> Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die! <BR> You'll be dead soon enough anyway so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore... <BR> I... I never lied! <BR> If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this... <BR> I am true -- to my Lord the King of Heaven.  He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me... <BR> 
2622,Heineken. <BR> FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
2623,Yes Yes I know. Victor whatever I do will you believe that I that -- <BR> -- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight dear.
2624,We were good when you bailed weren't we? <BR> Very good... <BR> Cos there were those dark days when I figured - my God how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process. <BR> No way ... <BR> No ... ? <BR> No ...
2625,This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world-- <BR> 1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before. <BR> That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work good lab work good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal special agent? <BR> Zero distortion sir.
2626,Satch you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here. <BR> I'm sorry Frank but you need to come outside.
2627,Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured. <BR> Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
2628,It's coming along. At the rate he's going he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer. <BR> Wonderful. When your next book is published maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
2629,How can you do that man? <BR> Do what? <BR> Sleep all day. I mean look it's already getting dark outside and you're just getting up. <BR> Um Libbets Casey. <BR> What? <BR> Aha! I could sense the vibe. <BR> What do you mean? <BR> Am I right or am I right? <BR> Shit. You're not planning -- <BR> My man I speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid. I've been giving this one a lot of thought and I believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that --
2630,What? <BR> When we first met when you were 7 where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address? <BR> 112 Orchard Way. [Realizing in a whisper] You're not coming back are you?
2631,What! <BR> Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is are you married or seriously involved with a significant other? <BR> No! At least I don't think I am! <BR> Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you? <BR> An invitation?
2632,You shouldn't have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it. <BR> Sure ok..
2633,"You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good... <BR> But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection... <BR> Sonny, yonder's a passel of murderers, complete with Texican scalps an' white girl captive...You want to protect us, you just get out of our way...Now <U>skedaddle</U>!"
2634,What's- It's me open up. <BR> Oh. <BR> Are you okay?  What's the matter?  Are you all right? What- <BR> There's a spider in the bathroom. <BR> What? <BR> There's a big black spider in the bathroom. <BR> That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom? <BR> My God I mean you know how I am about insects. <BR> Oooh. <BR> I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom. <BR> Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house? <BR> No.
2635,Hey. <BR> Hey--that coffee?  You're a goddess. Gimme gimme...So what you gals talk about?
2636,Im really sorry you were not called... <BR> Youre repeating yourself Mrs De Moraes. <BR> I... Well were burying Leon tomorrow and... Look I wish I had more time but its late and with the funeral... <BR> Arent you curious to know about Friedman? <BR> I... If you dont mind I do not think he matters now. It... Things turned out to be as we thought; Leon was weak. Theres no point in delving into his sad life anymore. Now will you please tell me how much we owe you?
2637,He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him. <BR> Killed outright? <BR> No. He was strong he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me I had nobody. I was ten years old. <BR> You're very frank Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life. <BR> Quid pro quo Doctor. <BR> The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change too Clarice. But there's the problem of his size you see. Even if he were a woman he'd have to be a big one... <BR> Dr. Lecter there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive. <BR> Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that? <BR> No. Tell me why. <BR> After your father's death you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes Clarice. <BR> I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch. <BR> A cattle ranch? <BR> Horses - and sheep... <BR> How long did you live there? <BR> Two months. <BR> Why so briefly? <BR> I - ran away... <BR> Why Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you? <BR> No. <BR> Did he try to? <BR> No...! Quid pro quo Doctor. <BR> Billy's not a real transsexual but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things I expect. <BR> You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him. <BR> There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins the University of Minnesota and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them and been rejected. <BR> On what basis would they reject him? <BR> The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach Wechsler House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual. <BR> How would he test?
2638,Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.' Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon -- what? <BR> 'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.
2639,The pause that refreshes --  Care for some? Smells good doesn't it? Pungent with just an irrepressible hint of iron. <BR> Pass. <BR> You sure now? I bled a newborn for this. You won't find a drink that's sweeter.
2640,Honey it's not the end of the world.  You'll call Lowenthal tomorrow and find out it was just a mix-up.  And if he's not interested anymore then you'll find another company to go to maybe even your own.  You are free now you are independent. <BR> I'm <u>fired</u>.  I'm unemployed.  Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength?  Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off! <BR> That's not the case. <BR> Someone blew the whistle.  Someone hates me.
2641,After hanging up there a few days you will be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM! <BR> NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!! <BR> I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island? <BR> Two of us...only two of us...me...and him.  <BR> I don't believe you rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland? <BR> The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there... <BR> Where are your headquarters rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER! <BR> There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won. <BR> Then why did you come here? <BR> To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place... <BR> How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come? <BR> Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
2642,I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...! <BR> Silence her!  Take her away...!
2643,It's not here Caesar. <BR> Where then? <BR> I don't know.  it could be anywhere. We don't even know if he was alone. Please Caesar we don't have much time.  Let's get out of here.
2644,Why haven't they killed the juice? <BR> Switches are shorted out. <BR> You're shitting me! <BR> Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it but it's gonna take awhile. <BR> We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out now. <BR> We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
2645,Sorry didn't mean to scare you. <BR> Where is everyone? <BR> I don't know I just got here. Did you find your girl?
2646,Bruno called. In Europe people are saying you're gonna die from drugs. They think they can cash in on your death. <BR> When I was poor everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich everyone said `yeah but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs anyway. I'm healthy now.
2647,Did you get an erection? <BR> I was six years old! <BR> I meant later... when you two took naps.
2648,...I know you don't want to be an accessory to something like that. <BR> Nope. <BR> So you think you might remember who those folks were who called ya?
2649,Yeah maybe you're right. <BR> You see how nice things are when we go slow?
2650,How old is your cousin? <BR> Seventeen.  She's a senior. <BR> I'm not crazy about blind dates.
2651,Hello Dwight. <BR> Miss Weathers. <BR> I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned... <BR> I'm on crowd patrol Miss Weathers excuse me.
2652,I was looking forward to seeing him. <BR> Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him. <BR> That's a terrific idea. <BR> He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
2653,Sit down Gino! <BR> No Caesar gimme the gun. <BR> Stay away!
2654,Yeah. No thanks. <BR> Please. Why not? <BR> Because it was a lie.
2655,David.  There's a call for you.  It's your wife. <BR> Great.  Classic timing.  Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  I'll check my diary later.
2656,Okay!  We have TV!  We can all get stupid again! <BR> What about cable? <BR> We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then? <BR> No.
2657,A simple theological discussion. <BR> Aramis -- the King wishes to see you. <BR> Still you serve him loyally -- though people hurl rotten eggs at his royal emblem.
2658,Its wet. Will this do? <BR> Wheres your wallet? Have you got a wallet? <BR> Is this some kind of mugging? Because... <BR> Shut up! Wheres your wallet? <BR> In my jacket. Left inside pocket. <BR> Reach for it and throw it to me. And... My fingers on the trigger you hear!
2659,Hi.  It's Ruiz.  Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye. <BR> What's up? <BR> He wants to see us now. <BR> Where? <BR> He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know. <BR> We're getting whacked. <BR> We're not getting whacked. <BR> Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is? <BR> It's not a 'sit down.' He said he's telling us the plan.
2660,Clever fuckers. <BR> What the hell's going on here!?
2661,Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father? <BR> No!... Yes a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out... <BR> Over the water department or over you? <BR> Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me? <BR> Then it was over the water department. <BR> Not exactly. Well I mean yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke. <BR> Oh yeah? <BR> Yes. He never forgave him for it. <BR> Never forgave him for what? <BR> For talking him into building it he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day. <BR> You sure shout that? <BR> Of course I'm sure. <BR> What about you? Do you and your father get along?
2662,- All's I know is ya got a problem ya call a professional! <BR> No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that Wade! They said you call the cops and we - <BR> Well a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go. <BR> Well they - <BR> A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are they got my daughter! <BR> Yah but think this thing through here Wade. Ya give 'em what they want why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one Wade. <BR> Heck you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin' the cops they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional! <BR> No! No cops! That's final! This is my deal here Wade! Jean is my wife here!
2663,Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago?? <BR> 
2664, <BR> You crashed my file? <BR> No. I consulted it. We're going into Indian Country I wanna know what kind of individual is covering my ass. Don't you?
2665,Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list find out where they live when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans -- <BR> Where we going -- ? <BR> We're going shopping -- !
2666,Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin. <BR> How? <BR> With a retrovirus. It's injected into the bone marrow cells it causes the host's DNA to mutate. They've been using them to treat Sickle-cell anemia.
2667,WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?! <BR> Dude they cut out 92 minutes!
2668,No ..........I. <BR> I...I mean......I...it's none of my business. <BR> She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think. <BR> She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star but sometimes people end up being both and that is I guess you'd say sort of why I came here. I'm sorry I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel. <BR> I think I've been hurt. <BR> Oh...
2669,You okay Rose? <BR> I guess you must like watchin' me be sick... <BR> I don't like watching anyone be sick.
2670,Are you sure they're home? Did you call? <BR> The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
2671,Don't let me down. <BR> You?! How about me? <BR> You have two minutes and thirty- two seconds.
2672,"You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed. <BR> I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry. <BR> Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us. <BR> That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?"
2673,Relax Dick it's just me ... The desert's so beautiful isn't it?  I want to go home Dick.  Time to go home. <BR> You're not gonna quit on me are you Harold?
2674,I told you. He gave them to me. <BR> Why? When? <BR> I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you. <BR> I don't believe you. <BR> It's all true. <BR> I don't believe a single word you've said.
2675,The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen? <BR> What is he talking about?
2676,What are we gonna do -- ? <BR> Hospital. <BR> We can't do that dude --
2677,Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting -- <BR> You called 911. Except the call was intercepted. <BR> They took her --
2678,See?  We're for real. <BR> I'm sorry it's just you hear stories. <BR> You did the right thing.
2679,Great. <BR> From my wise albeit youthful vantage point the world is your oyster. You scored big.
2680,Hey what is this? You got black soap? <BR> It's for my complexion. <BR> Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em? <BR> Oh don't go okay? Please. <BR> Whatta you mean don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter? <BR> Oh uh I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.
2681,Looks bearish to me buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay I'm giving this to you and you alone 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest. <BR> Thanks Marv with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.
2682,--I want you to shut up and listen to me-- <BR> --I haven't said anything-- <BR> --for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats dirty tricks shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing. <BR> How high up which Republicans? <BR> That's what we've got to find out but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men-- <BR> --Haldeman I know who else? <BR> Dwight Chapin Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories? <BR> The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans. <BR> Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in. <BR> So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece-- <BR> --because a year before the Republicans weren't ahead not in the polls Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed. <BR> If he self-destructed.
2683,No. <BR> No? <BR> No. No you definitely cannot do that Mark. That's a big fat sack of no! <BR> What's the matter? <BR> This isn't what we agreed on. You guys have to take care of... this! You are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!
2684,She's settlin'. <BR> What you figger to do? <BR> It's hard to say. Stay here till mornin' an' then go on over to Uncle John's I reckon. After that I don't know.
2685,Go to the movies. <BR> All right. <BR> No foolin'? Will you? <BR> Certainly.  Tell me Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
2686,I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know. <BR> We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate? <BR> Got to learn like I'm a-learnin'. Don't know it right yet myself but I'm tryin' to fin' out. That's why I can't ever be a preacher again. Preacher got to *know*.  I don't. I got to *ask*.
2687,I'm a scientist.  I have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is Argon is going to get whatever he wants so if I were you I'd give it to him. <BR> You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him? <BR> I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him. <BR> Make me?  How?  You think he's going to torture me?
2688,...this is magnificent. <BR> ...Stanley Moss... <BR> 8 days and we bring it back home....
2689,Course she settled down nicely. <BR> Well you never know do you? <BR> That's for sure. <BR> Why'd she run away? <BR> Oh you know. She was sixteen or seventeen. <BR> We missed the best of it didn't we pal?
2690,Yeah? How's our new witness? <BR> D'you find the obstetric nurse? <BR> She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now I'm going over there to talk to... <BR> Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
2691,The Voice again. <BR> I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals. <BR> Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal? <BR> Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat upon heat upon heat. <BR> It burns. <BR> SILENCE... SILENCE. <BR>  I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling. <BR> You feel the flesh crisping?
2692,I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God. <BR> You didn't think I could just leave you? <BR> I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you. <BR> What could happen?  I'm the plastic man remember?
2693,I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that. <BR> Hey relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em see? <BR> Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me. <BR> Hey come here guy.
2694,I... I just hired these guys to watch my back... <BR> Motherfucker we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
2695,I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner. <BR> Now? <BR> Better today than tomorrow. <BR> Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do.
2696,The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off getting away running... <BR> Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
2697,--that leaves Haldeman period. <BR> I'm not your source on that.
2698,Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on? <BR> Until your confirmation date.
2699,Your ideas never work out. <BR> Oh really? Starbucks?
2700,It's imperative that you get that truck moving. <BR> Just cover me. It was built to move.
2701,Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame. <BR> Yeah against that prick VanDeMark. <BR> Ten thousand to one but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame. <BR> That game was before you was born. <BR> My mom was there. She told me about it. The 'Fazeli Split.'
2702,Why did you kill Friedman? <BR> Let me give you a tip asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. Its wrong. Fucking wrong. <BR> Why did you kill him? <BR> Huh! You turned him into a liability didnt you know? <BR> Nice way to help a colleague in trouble. <BR> Thats just it. The sonofabitch didnt ask for help from his colleagues...  Testa di cazzo! Hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you... He hasnt gone to hell too soon... And neither will you Mr Lamont!
2703,You'll need these. Tonight. For the play. <BR> Don't make me sit through one of your plays. <BR> Hey Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think. <BR> Since when did that matter? <BR> Let's not start that again. <BR> My back is killing me. <BR> Where's your elastic brace? <BR> I can't find it. <BR> You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble. <BR> I lost it. I lose everything. <BR> I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
2704,Yes sure we did go to San Remo. That was months ago. <BR> November I thought. <BR> Was it? Did you speak to Tom? <BR> November 7th is my information. <BR> I don't remember the exact date. <BR> And when did you last see Signor Ripley? <BR> A few days ago. <BR> Does he stay with you here? <BR> No! <BR> No. Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead -- he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat. <BR> It's not a pattern it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day. <BR> 31 people. <BR> 31 people.
2705,Mom have you seen Woody? <BR> Where was the last place you left him? <BR> Right here in the van. <BR> Oh I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough. <BR> He's not here Mom.  Woody's gone.
2706,This one has eyes.  Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever.... <BR> No!....
2707,I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity. <BR> Thanks. <BR> We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where. <BR> Do that.
2708,Well thank you for all your help Mrs. Johnson. <BR> Francesca. <BR> Francesca. Robert.
2709,What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone? <BR> I'm looking for you actually. <BR> Am I in trouble or something? <BR> Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught prepared. <BR> What are you talking about? <BR> I've searched the entire world for you Buffy. <BR> Why? <BR> To bring you... your birthright. <BR> My birthright?  You mean like a trust fund?
2710,I know what you're going to say. <BR> Do you? <BR> In the city it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop top a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  Call the cops.  What are we immune? <BR> It was bad wasn't it. <BR> The goddamn smell is always the same.  <BR> Are you going to be able to sleep? <BR> Yeah.   I think so.  Mike!  Keep it down for chrissake!
2711,...this the Guy. <BR> Oh he's gonna be Aces. <BR> Where is he now? <BR> Some military... Special Program Oklahoma somewhere... <BR> ...we get our hands on him? <BR> They got him standing by. <BR> What's the thing with Morse Code... <BR> Oh you're gonna love this:
2712,Jesus don't freeze on me.  What about the others? <BR> Sean's still out there. <BR> What?
2713,It turned out Phil Green Mr Integrity had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the Tangiers... <BR> Why are you doing this to me?
2714,You followed me. I can't believe it! <BR> I didn't follow you! <BR> You followed me! <BR> Why? 'Cause I... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following! <BR> Well what is your definition of following? <BR> Following is different. I was spying. <BR> Do you realize how paranoid you are? <BR> Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy. <BR> That is the worst kind of paranoia. <BR> Yeah-well I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school. <BR> Yeah-well you wanted to keep the relationship flexible remember? It's your phrase. <BR>  <BR>  <BR> What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation. <BR> Oh well now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about!
2715,Oscar wants you to call him. <BR> So who'd you go to lunch with? <BR> With Jennifer. <BR> And where'd you go? <BR> To the Riviera. <BR> What'd you have? <BR> I had a... salad. <BR> What did Jennifer have? <BR> She had the same. <BR> Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch and I'm gonna listen in on the other line. <BR> Why do you want to do that? <BR> You know why I want to do it. Just do it. <BR> Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing. <BR> Mm.
2716,What in Christ's name is going on?! <BR> Isn't it obvious?
2717,No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner. <BR> Man that is love.
2718,My name's Sophia. <BR> Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
2719,Get ready Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight! <BR> As long as we keep moving. No standing still. <BR> C'mon look at your screen. Give up some blood!
2720,...you big fuckin' hick you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here. <BR> Get up. <BR> Come here come here. <BR> Get up. <BR> You go over there right now and you apologize. You better hope he lets you back in.
2721,"OVER A SLEEPING BREAN, STRETCHED OUT ON A POOLCHAIR, GRACE, THE SECRETARY, COMES OUT ON TO THE POOL AREA, HOLDING THE SHOT OF A SMALL, FOREIGN LOOKING CHILD, IN FRONT OF A PILE OF RUBBLE. SHE SHOWS IT TO MOSS. <BR> ...we own it?"
2722,Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't... <BR> That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here. <BR> At the end is the tail of what could be an 'r.
2723,Sun rises at 5:52. <BR> I'm not wrecking the transmission!
2724,What the heck Jerry if I wanted bank interest on seven hunnert'n fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest Federal. Talk to Bill Diehl. <BR> He's at Norstar. <BR> He's at -
2725,You wanted me to kill him didn't you? <BR> If he's not dead he'll keep coming back. <BR> He's dead Sheila. <BR> I feel sick. <BR> You should. <BR> Are you sure he's dead? <BR> I didn't stop to take his pulse.
2726,...well see him? <BR> Yeah but he didn't see me. <BR> Cheer up buddy buddy. You shook Gekko the Great's hand and you still got all your fingers. He's not the only elephant in the jungle.
2727,Holy shit this guy's all fucked up! <BR> No shit he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
2728,Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff. <BR> Cassandra you gotta come too.
2729,"Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country. <BR> Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too.... <BR> Ain't that too bad...If you feel that sorry for your kinfolk, I'm surprised you didn't take up with that squaw wife of yours..."
2730,The king said you're his finest archer...? <BR> Well... <BR> Come with me...
2731,John doesn't subscribe to Chaos particularly what it has to say about his little science project! <BR> Codswollop!  Ian you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island! <BR> I certainly have!  Very clearly!  Because of the behavior of the system in phase space!
2732,We just need about six weeks in about six weeks we could cut a whole album. <BR> I don't know this is strange to me you know. <BR> Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here. <BR> Oh. <BR> There's a whole wing in this house. <BR> Oh yeah stay here? U-huh. <BR> You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling? <BR> I don't know. I don't know.
2733,Out of self comes selflessness. <BR> Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you.
2734,Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do? <BR> I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
2735,How many of you are there? <BR> A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight. <BR> What happens then? <BR> The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it. <BR> LaMagra -- <BR> That's right. The answers were there all along of course scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.
2736,You all right? <BR> I'm fine. <BR> How's the bottle? <BR> Half-full.
2737,Well you see Billy it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade. <BR> But just... <BR> Just what? <BR> I just needed some extra money.  I was broke the guy offered me the hash and...
2738,Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true. <BR> I don't know how you know about Eugene but these ideas are part of your delusions. <BR> NO! They're not my delusions! Look just leave my business with Becker to me!
2739,Darn clever these Armenians. <BR> Yeah. Yeah it's a gift.  <BR> I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband. <BR> Oh I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs.  <BR> Oh you did? What am I expected to doleap for joy? <BR> I kind of half expected you to thank me. <BR> Your ego is colossal. <BR> Yeah. Yeah not bad. How's your's?
2740,They were all French guys. <BR>  <BR> Yeah French guys from France. <BR>  <BR> Everything. <BR>  <BR> Everything. <BR>  <BR> Well you know when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night stick guns in my face tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me. <BR>  <BR> You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me. <BR>  <BR> If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them would you? <BR>  <BR> Just find them! <BR> 
2741,I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow. <BR> Aren't you coming back with me? <BR> Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this. <BR> ...That's not what I meant.
2742,You know after doing that job for so many years you learn to appreciate the simple things in life.  Flowers incorporate a beauty that I always missed in life.  But certainly you're not here to chat about my hobbies. <BR> 1976.  What happened back then?
2743,You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. But you did. Beautifully. I heard you. <BR> What will happen if I do? <BR> Someone will talk to your daddy. And then he'll stop doing those things... the things you don't like.
2744,Flynn we've got to help him! <BR> Let's get some power here.
2745,Boy or girl? <BR> As long as it looks like her I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
2746,As of now they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state Special Task Force FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy. <BR> Yeah right. <BR> Look Sid why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you. <BR> No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
2747,Hey!  Where did you find those things? <BR> In a box under my seat. <BR> Are they heavy? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Then they're expensive.  Put them back.
2748,I was getting to it. <BR> Getting to what? <BR> The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative -- <BR> I fail to see --
2749,Yes? <BR> Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe. <BR> Mr. Wayne is out for the day. <BR> Actually I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne would you?
2750,Hey I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit so why not take advantage right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well within a few years by doin' all of this he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him. <BR> Between...
2751,How many would you say? <BR> Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math. <BR> You know a girl in my sorority Tracy Marcinko got a perm once. Even though we all told her not to. Curls really weren't the right look for her --  She didn't have your bone structure.
2752,Isn't she lovely? <BR> Mommy and Daddy love you Baby. <BR> She walks in beauty... <BR> We love you Baby. <BR> We all love Janet...Who do we love?
2753,You know how to work a radio don't you? <BR> You're going too? <BR> I lost everything I came after on this trip but one T-rex in one theme park could single-handedly bail InGen out of Chapter 11.
2754,What do you want the kid to say? <BR> Have him say 'I know we're all concerned for the President there will he an update at 5:45.'
2755,Wise beyond her years I'm sure and such poise too.  Very very impressive... <BR> Well then did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
2756,This is the life baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK! <BR> Cut it out before you break something! <BR> For a guy about to try his first Dom Perignon you are extremely uptight.
2757,You really think I'm attractive? <BR> For a butt-head? Yes.
2758,Doctor Peel I presume? <BR> And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
2759,- no matter where he was or what he was doing he always went home to make breakfast for his son Nicky- Boy. <BR> Here let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter right not a lot?
2760,Is there a press conference today? <BR> What do <u>you</u> think?  What I need from you:  I need a base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I need some clean <u>money</u> ...
2761,Don't get too excited Fuzzy. <BR> Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas anyway.
2762,Well you don't look any the worse for wear Mr. Gittes I must say... where's the girl?... <BR> I've got her. <BR> Is she all right? <BR> She's fine. <BR> Where is she? <BR> With her mother.
2763,Sire!  I -- How did you -- <BR> How did I get in?  You're new here and will soon learn many secrets. What is that? <BR> ... Nothing. <BR> A letter.  May I see?
2764,Hey man good to see you. <BR> This is April Lee Auggie. April say hello to Auggie Wren.
2765,Really? What are they like? <BR> The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today. <BR> Is that normal? <BR> I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks so we should be safe. <BR> Oh. That's a relief.
2766,Four-fifty.  That's the address... <BR> Looks familiar? <BR> No.  No.  Go around.  Keep going...
2767,Some unfinished business. <BR> If you wanna do business in this town there's other people around here got more weight than old Faz.
2768,Is the flight full? <BR> I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed. <BR> Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
2769,Do you know where fuse box is? <BR> In the cellar I think. Wait I'll take care of it.
2770,Fuck you! Fuck you! <BR> Yeah? <BR> You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?! <BR> Now move along. <BR> You fuckin' faggot! Do you know who you're fuckin' with?
2771,Pier Angeli 1971 or '72 also pills. Charles Boyer 1978 pills again. Charles Butterworth 1946 I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an accident but you know...  He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge she took pills in like 1965. Albert Dekker 1968 he hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd '64 more pills Carole Landis pills again I forget when. George Reeves Superman on TV shot himself. Jean Seberg pills of course 1979. Everett Sioane -- he was good -- pills. Margaret Sullavan pills Lupe Velez a lot of pills. Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 1978. There are more but I don't know if you would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia? <BR> I haven't heard of half of those.
2772,To Abraham Lincoln. <BR> L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life'] <BR> Here we go. Good luck.
2773,Better go back to your bed. <BR> I love you. <BR> You're forgetting you're married. <BR> I don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself.  Please Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you.  Oh Peter
2774,Josephine - <BR> I guess she's not in here. <BR> That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be. <BR> Well I'll come back later. <BR> No no Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute. <BR> Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing. <BR> Yeah.  This is one for Ripley. <BR> Do you suppose she went out shopping? <BR> That's it.  Something tells me she's going to walk through that door in a whole new outfit.
2775,Well how about those old romantic movies with those great stars huh? Like Audrey Hepburn. <BR> Actually I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
2776,That's good goddamn work Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver. <BR> Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant? <BR> Her own people start to suspect her it creates discord from within. The Warriors don't know who to trust they start infighting and Jimmy loses his support.
2777,Long live the fighters! <BR> Long live the fighters!
2778,Well she picked the most prosperous looking one. <BR> She's not in love with him -- or any of them. <BR> How can you tell that -- from here? <BR> You said it resembled my apartment didn't you?
2779,Try again and this time be polite. <BR> I can only tell you what he told us... <BR> Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call. <BR> Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman whod called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously. <BR> What sums? <BR> Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didnt need your confession... <BR> Youre sure he said his caller was a man? <BR> Thats what he said...
2780,Annie there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker it will run out the other side you know what I mean? <BR> Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera. <BR> You know I-I think... if I could pry this door off... We shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs. They don't run around.
2781,You planned this whole thing didn't you? <BR> Where's the fucking money?
2782,He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...! <BR> How dare you tell me what God tells me to do! <BR> Alright whatever -- but since He's not going to come down and cut it himself at least let someone cut it properly!
2783,June twenty-third '72 sir.  The part that's underlined.  Your instructions to Haldeman regarding the CIA and the FBI. <BR> So? <BR>  <BR> It's totally out of context.  I was protecting the national security.  I never intended -- <BR> Sir the deadline is today. <BR> Can we get around this Al? <BR> It's the Supreme Court sir; you don't get around it.
2784,Hi guys. <BR> Hi. <BR> Have you guys seen Jeffrey?  The limo never showed I thought he might be here.
2785,Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky. <BR> Yeah I guess. <BR> My mom doesn't go anywhere.  She even does the shopping network. I'm gonna die a virgin.
2786,Okay. <BR> You fuckin' piece of shit. <BR> Hey that's just fuckin' - That's bullshit. You know you know what the fuck?
2787,Where'd you get that... ? <BR> ... what... ? <BR> That gun.  That... that's not automatic.  The guard had an automatic...
2788,Sorry 'bout that. <BR> What'd you just say? <BR> Oh that was my kid.
2789,I'm so glad you could come Mr.-- <BR> --I'm Woodward.
2790,A 'stately pleasure home' indeed. <BR> Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor.  As a matter of fact...
2791,What? <BR> Jesus Benjamin you're still as gullible as ever. <BR> That was a joke? You don't tell jokes. <BR> I thought I'd start trying. If you don't mind. But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse.
2792,You mean the time you're locked away? <BR> No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time you feel time you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live it just beats... time. <BR> I'm sorry Walter. <BR> Don't be sorry for me. I did those things. No one else did. I'm dealing with that.
2793,Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats. <BR> First they try to kill me now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
2794,I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow. <BR> Okay. Then tomorrow I take the kids with me to the picket line.
2795,He I.D.'d the assailant. The description matches you pretty well. <BR> I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty medium height medium weight medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill. <BR> Just give me a straight answer Walter cause the irony goes right over my head.
2796,You're all set sir.  Just push this button.  Good night Mr. President. <BR> You know Al men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room. <BR> I don't have a pistol. <BR> 'Night Al.
2797,Yes...acknowledge Master Control... <BR> End of line.
2798,Tell me something honestly you ever have second thoughts about us? <BR> Sometimes --
2799,It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us... <BR> I assure you Charles the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne... <BR> I... I can't stop her.
2800,Hi. <BR> Hi. <BR> I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different. <BR> You like your dad's paintings? <BR> Some of them. <BR> Stand still.
2801,Charlie you've gotta - you've gotta stop her! <BR> I-I'm sorry Sam. <BR> You've got to stop her. <BR> What can I do? <BR> She's a fuckin' junkie. She's out of her fucking mind.  Do you unders-
2802,Why certainly sir. My fiancée. Charlotte may I present Mr. Igor. <BR> Delighted I'm sure. 
2803,It's not worth it Tom. He's surrendering. <BR> No prisoners. Don't worry Frank just a little psychological first aid.
2804,Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber. <BR> Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side? <BR> Huge. <BR> What are you hoping to find inside?
2805,Do you want to sit there Jeff? <BR> I don't know. I guess so. <BR> Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here.  As I explained to your parents just a moment ago and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson.
2806,Ray. X22. <BR> I read Cooch. <BR> Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down. <BR> Good. <BR> They took it down set fire to it and threw it on the doorstep of room 13 at the Buffalo Butte Motel. Your room.
2807,You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks. <BR> Ignorant art? <BR> Yeah... Like  stupid ridiculous crummy art. <BR> Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good. <BR> Ten bucks apiece. <BR> I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these. <BR> You don't even work on your stuff!
2808,Where's Hunt now? <BR> In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me. <BR> And? <BR> He wants money. <BR> Pay him. <BR> Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ... <BR> What the hell are you doing Ehrlichman?  Screwing with the CIA?  I don't care how much he wants -- pay him.
2809,Someday I'll find out. <BR> You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
2810,Let me drive you home. <BR> Fuck you Joel. Faggot. <BR> Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy.
2811,Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it. <BR> Who's driving the boat? <BR> Nobody. We're drifting with the current.
2812,Hey... very tense. <BR> Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl when we got married you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost? <BR> Five hundred; six maybe. <BR> You're two months behind--you got enough to cover? <BR> I think. <BR> Give me your checkbook then. <BR> It's right under that pile.
2813,How ya doin' Wade? <BR> What's goin' on there? <BR> Oh nothing Wade. How ya doin' there? <BR> Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet. <BR> No kiddin'? <BR> We might be innarested. <BR> No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal. <BR> Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman. <BR> Yah. <BR> 2:30.
2814,Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages were constructed for the King's security not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death! <BR> It is for your security that I have come your Majesty -- for the security of your honor. <BR> I already know about the riots d'Artagnan I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow. <BR> Then there is one more thing of an even more personal nature. <BR> A personal nature? <BR> Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She is betrothed to Raoul the son of Athos the Musketeer who has served France through many tribulations.
2815,Toy? <BR> T-O-Y.  Toy. <BR> Excuse me I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger. <BR> The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
2816,Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins? <BR> I didnt know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? Ive known for five years. Hes known Ive known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesnt speak about... <BR> One just doesnt... Tell me what does one speak about huh? <BR> Think what you like. But dont presume to understand. <BR> I dont. <BR> Good. <BR> Is there anything to understand? <BR> Why do I feel I neednt answer that? <BR> Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids. <BR> You bastard... <BR> Five years of it. Surely youd have divorced him if he disgusted you? <BR> You splendid bastard... <BR> Are there truly no extenuating circumstances? <BR> ...Were turning in circles. <BR> And you still havent told me why you sent me after Friedman. <BR> Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright. <BR> A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright? <BR> I didnt know who or what had happened to my brother yet Mr Lombard! <BR> What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed? <BR> Something like that. <BR> Something like that? <BR> Something like that. <BR> What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice? <BR> Here we go again. <BR> Where is that? <BR> Simplify and damn. <BR> Dont you believe in simplicity? <BR> Should I? <BR> We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But its never that complicated really. <BR> You seem to know what youre talking about. <BR> Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little. <BR> My husband didnt need to slap me about Mr Lombard. I volunteered... <BR> To get me killed...? <BR> I didnt intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that youd been back.  That wed argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldnt help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before you see... <BR> Well I hope you enjoyed yourself. <BR> Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. Thats when he hit me and told me hed killed my brother... You dont know what youve done he said.  Were in deep trouble he said. We he said. We.  Wed both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
2817,Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head? <BR> What people? <BR> What people! What'd you think I wasn't gonna find out? <BR> I don't even know what you're talkin' about Nick. <BR> No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army pal! <BR> I didn't do anything. I mean I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you and that was a problem. <BR> You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?! <BR> Yeah I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino it's my ass. It's not yours it's my ass. <BR> Oh I don't know whether you know this or not but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible! <BR> I - <BR> I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?! <BR> What are you - <BR> You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit! <BR> I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on. <BR> Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV. <BR> Yeah I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right. <BR> You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself. <BR> Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean every time I meet somebody here the big question is do I know you. <BR> Oh sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me is that it? <BR> No it - it - Nicky when you asked me if you could come out here what did I tell you? I mean you asked me and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told... <BR> Back - <BR> ...you? Do you remember what I told you? <BR> Back - Back up back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head you - <BR> You never - ? <BR> Get this through your head you Jew motherfucker you. You only exist out here because of me!  That's the only reason!  Without me you personally every fuckin' wiseguy skell [Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! You motherfucker you!
2818,Twicet now I've fell for that line. Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he get's five thousan' there an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry.  'F he wants to hire men let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license. <BR> Joe!
2819,What do you want? You must desire it for me to weave it. <BR> Walls of shining crystals burning with red fire furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...

2821,You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders? <BR> Yeah. <BR> I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him? <BR> That's Deleon and Hayes' collar. <BR> They around? <BR> Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad. <BR> Where's the collar in the cells? <BR> No I think he's up in interrogation. <BR> I'll go find Hayes.
2822,How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing. <BR> Don't worry about me Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself.  There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.
2823,Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks Geronimo? What's your name? <BR> It ain't Geronimo. <BR> Who are you? <BR> I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.
2824,Okay? <BR> Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
2825,"What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank? <BR> No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU. <BR> Nonsense, I... <BR> It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!"
2826,Show us a little more cooperation first.  Where were you born? <BR> In a village called Domremy. <BR> How old are you? <BR> Nineteen... or thereabouts... <BR> Were you baptized? <BR> Yes.  In the church at Domremy. <BR> Recite the Lord's Prayer. <BR> Not unless you hear my confession.
2827,-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links -- <BR> -- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --
2828,Listen your Aunt Ester just died. I'm... sorry... Listen I really Feel bad now about last night...We had no... <BR> I'm in a hurry gonna see this great group record at Woodland. <BR> I mean Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and... <BR> I don't really know what you're talking about.
2829,What um...  What do we do? <BR> There's a great deal I have to show you I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time. <BR> Why do you keep saying that? <BR> Do you know what a Vampire-King is? <BR> A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula? <BR> Oh yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos. <BR> Oh him. <BR> Yes.  They travel about usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it make it their own.  You were difficult to trace and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason nobody here seems to be paying any attention. <BR> What? <BR> We'll cover it later. <BR> I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy and his buddies? <BR> In a way yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them. <BR> Great.  First I have a birthright now I've got a fate.  Hey do I have to take notes on this? <BR> We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
2830,What? <BR> They can come to the concert in the park. <BR> I said 'no!'
2831,I guess ... <BR> You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or if you really wanted to get after it: Miles. <BR> okay ... <BR> It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV on that shit. But never never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ? <BR> Got it ... <BR> Good.
2832,And I would like to see a priest. <BR> Now? <BR> Yes.  I didn't confess today. <BR> Right.  Raymond... a priest.
2833,I bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using it was in his contract.  Cost a nice penny too especially that goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes. <BR> Check this out.  Gregor's a spook or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think... <BR> That we're too stupid to trace his calls.
2834,I tried calling last night but your father -- <BR> Evan Shaeffer's dead.
2835,There is nothing to discuss. <BR> Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach you shoot up the place God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us. <BR> Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary. <BR> You don't make enough. <BR> Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here but I don't work the same way. <BR> What's that supposed to mean? <BR> It means I don't like all that grab-ass and heavy breathing with my wife it means I know who's out to screw me here and it means that I know something none of you know because I've been there -- and I don't want to go through that horror again.  Ever!
2836,I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell. <BR> That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor. <BR> I'll do the same for you sometime.
2837,--I saw him. He verifies. <BR> OK.  You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook.  Just be right huh?
2838,Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead! <BR> You want Zero to kill him? <BR> I'm going to kill him myself! <BR> What about the money?
2839,The Welsh dude sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit he gets nervous. But you motherfuckers he just laughs. All beat up in your babaloo suit like Fruitpie the Magician. <BR> So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything? <BR> Dude you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta. <BR> Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split.
2840,How you figure? <BR> News last night... those guys the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.
2841,Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address name of Seamus Reilly. <BR> Seamus Reilly.
2842,Do you have any music? <BR> What? <BR> Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked. <BR> John play the Sinatra.
2843,Ah you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole! <BR> Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!
2844,It's my first cigarette in over a year. <BR> The first is always the best. <BR> It's the waiting that's killing me not knowing you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes close the door. <BR> You never know. <BR> I mean if he was dead I could handle that. <BR> At least he's got people around him. <BR> I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack that he'd locked himself in the bathroom all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed I thought of all these other things I wanted to say. <BR> Even when you say the things there's always more things. <BR> Right now I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father. <BR> Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now. <BR> That's what I told her. If she could just see him a second then I could take her home.
2845,Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns. <BR> They do what I tell 'em. <BR> Salvatore. Always holding himself above. <BR> You and me both. Sal-va-to-re.
2846,You ever come to your father's grave anymore? <BR> No not anymore. It's too... it's too far. <BR> We should talk. <BR> We've done all our talking Wade. <BR> It's just... <BR> Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
2847,I never did trust that blonde fuck... <BR> That's why you were riding with him.
2848,"That isn't a waiter, my dear. That's a butler. <BR>  <BR> You have a point. An idiotic one but a point. <BR> I don't want to make trouble. All I want is a drink."
2849,Go on. <BR> But -- what is Porthos doing? <BR> Going into the barn naked -- or so it appears.
2850,Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it. <BR> I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'. <BR> Give 'im a fryin' pan. 
2851,Your Majesty.  This ball with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking -- <BR> You will protect me as you always have d'Artagnan.
2852,You done with your small talk? <BR> Sure. <BR> Good.

And I think we get you bail. If very bad maybe twenty month sentence... But I think we get you bail...
2855,Oh yes you will my dear - oh yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too! <BR> Oh you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon spoon. Oh no I won't wear garters <BR> Oh yes you will wear garters
2856,First of all what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year. <BR> These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from - <BR> Walk away? Andy you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake? <BR> The old man said 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe' that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit you should run! <BR> Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers these cocksuckers they mention Nicky too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean what do you do about that? <BR> What do you propose? <BR> I don't know he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad? <BR> They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere. <BR> All right look if he took a break it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying. <BR> I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out. <BR> I can't do that.
2857,Jimmy? Bushmills.  Lookit do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow. <BR> Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight? <BR> I'm going to get laid.
2858,Where's my information? <BR> In here... <BR> Then you better find it in your heart to tell me Francois because while your death is inevitable it still isn't decided how painful it's going to be.
2859,Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass. <BR> He'd let you off at the nearest port that's for sure.
2860,Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you? <BR> No.
2861,The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week. <BR> And... <BR> He saw an owl.

2866,I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile? <BR> Chile Congo Guatemala Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability there's a Track 2.  In Cuba Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was our idea.  We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro.  So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead?  The Mafia the money people.   So we put together Track 2 ...

That night her boss he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all. <BR> FBI too? <BR> You don't believe me? Well I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate they never even asked me about it. <BR> If you don't like it down there why don't you quit? <BR> I don't know what they'd do to me. <BR> Hey easy... <BR> We're a long way from high school Carl...  ...and I'm scared.

2899,One fuckin' year ago I had ta hit you up for train fare. Now I can buy the fuckin' train. And I ain't even a fuckin' Sicilian! <BR> But ya got a Boss. <BR> Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him Charlie. He'd like you. <BR> Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
2900,You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go. <BR> Sorry can't do it brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn I hate this Johnny I really do.  I hate violence.  See that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat man! She was my woman once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion he won't stop. That's his gift a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes straight up he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do unless I get there.
2901,That's funny. His name is the same as yours. <BR> Well you and Junior have the same name too don't you? <BR> Yeah but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here and you're not even the same color. <BR> That's how we met. We're members of the International Same Name Club. Believe it or not there are 846 Paul Benjamins in America. But only two in the New York metropolitan area. That's how Paul and I got to be such good friends. We're the only ones who show up at the meetings.
2902,What was that?  You got something to say say it! Say it! <BR> Nothing. <BR> You no-good pup!
2903,...Chief Gunderson? <BR> Copy. Yah send me back-up! <BR> Yes ma'am. Are we the closest PD? <BR> Yah Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters.
2904,"The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction. <BR> They need leadership. <BR> That's what I'm saying. Let the Israelis straighten it up. They got plenty of room down there, number one. Plus, and this is just a plus, they kind of look alike - the Jews and the Mexicans. So I think on a whole your average Joe Mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing. Am I right?"
2905,So uh... <BR> Look if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is. <BR> Oh Jesus. <BR> If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you then yes he does. <BR> Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks. <BR> But you know so what?
2906,Oh no! <BR> Oh ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is!
2907,Need something else? <BR> No I was just... How you doing? <BR> Great. Good. Content... <BR> Oh. How come? <BR> I dunno. Job satisfaction I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top? <BR> They're fine... you miss it? <BR> You must be joking. <BR> Hmm.  So Del get that car he sold you up and running yet? <BR> Oh yeah he's got things up and running alright... <BR> 'Kay good. Bye then... <BR> Uh-huh.  Anyway I'm thinking Easter 'cause I just fucking love pastels.
2908,It's wonderful. I mean you know they just watch movies all day. <BR> Yeah and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while. <BR> Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful? <BR> Yeah she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side. But it's...
2909,Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school do you? <BR> No Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise. <BR> I know you're a good boy Clark. No mother could ask for better. It's just that...
2910,And that is? <BR> A tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and thus influence your perception.
2911,I thought you said Krueger burned to death. <BR> That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream it would kill you in the real world. <BR> Uh-huh... <BR> Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection. <BR> Yeah... I think I understand...  You're drunk too.
2912,"What is it you find incredible? <BR> Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism. <BR> No, they don't. <BR> Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation."
2913,How bizarre! <BR> Mr. Peterson are you sure mama wrote all this?
2914,Yeah. <BR> Well it was good to see you Daniel but I have to be going. <BR> Sure.  Can I ask you one more thing? You haven't published anything in a while.  How come?
2915,How do you feel about that? <BR> I don't feel anything. <BR> You have no feelings for your niece? <BR> She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings? <BR> Then why are you talking about this? <BR> Have to talk about something. <BR> What are you afraid will happen? <BR> I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer. <BR> Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns? <BR> I'm not that crazy. <BR> Do you think you're crazy? <BR> If I'm not then what the hell am I doing here? <BR> Why do you think you're here? <BR> You know why. It's part of the parole deal. <BR> Is that what you are angry about? <BR> Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round. <BR> That is a marvelous image Walter. Because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around.
2916,What's going on? <BR> Nothing...I just spilled something.
2917, <BR> Clearly I am here but only as an individual I'm not the attorney of record.  Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want you'll have to get from him I have nothing more to say.
2918,But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him. <BR> It wasn't like that. <BR> Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.
2919,Well it don't look pretty. <BR> But it's got teeth.
2920,That's Connie Rivers with her. They're married now.  She's due about three-four months. <BR> Why she wasn't no more'n a kid when I went up.
2921,"So you're into Reason too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you? <BR> Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it..."
2922,See I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you. <BR> Tell me Knox. If you've got the story why haven't you printed it? <BR> Because I...  ... Because she'd never speak to me again.
2923,Where is he?!! <BR> I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
2924,This is it Joel. It's gonna be gone soon. <BR> I know. <BR> What do we do? <BR> Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
2925,"Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running. <BR> I know, I met him."
2926,"Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like. <BR> Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean. <BR> Benjamin. That's supposed to explain it?"
2927,Then they lost? <BR> Why does it matter? <BR> If they lost tonight they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over. <BR> Why do you care? <BR> They're my team. <BR> No. They're not your team. They're my team.
2928,I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips! <BR> Now Betty don't overreact. <BR> Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver? <BR> Yes Betty. <BR> Are you spoken for this evening?
2929, <BR> I know where Dwight works. <BR> When did he hire you?
2930,He owned the water department? <BR> Yes. <BR> He owned the entire water supply for the city? <BR> Yes. <BR> How did they get it away from him? <BR> Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display. <BR> Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department. <BR> Along with Mr. Mulwray. <BR> They were partners. <BR> Yes. Yes they were partners.
2931,The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here? <BR> Yes... and no. When you come here you don't really care about the movie.
2932,Muley tol' me what happened Ma. Are we goin' to California true? <BR> We *got* to Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills about how much work they is an' high wages too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first Tommy.  Did they hurt you son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad? <BR> Mad Ma? <BR> Sometimes they do. <BR> No Ma I was at first--but not no more. <BR> Sometimes they do somethin' to you Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that Tommy? <BR> No Ma. You don't have to worry about that. <BR> Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son 
2933,What in bloody hell is going on? <BR> They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about. <BR> From Interpol? <BR> That's him.
2934,MOM!!  MOM!! <BR> She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
2935,No he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. But they weren't very important just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam. Now beat it Gittes you don't come out of this smelling like a rose you know. <BR> Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with? <BR> When I do you'll hear about it.
2936,"In the basement over at Janey and Jim's. With that weirdo Mikey. Not even a TV on. And they're on the floor and he's got his trousers down though thank goodness she's still dressed. Well, I really let him have it!  ... and Wendy came home peacefully... Hey, should I dress for the Halford's now, or - give me your - <BR> Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that. <BR> I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice. <BR> So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway? <BR> Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat. <BR> Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash. <BR> Yeah, that one. <BR> That one."
2937,"I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police... <BR> What's going on with the beaches, Chief?"
2938,How do you get this thing down? <BR> Tell me what happened Theo.
2939,I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night. <BR> She was unconscious Patrick. <BR> She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties is what. <BR> Jesus Patrick!
2940,So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed Bruce. You know that don't you? <BR> No one would miss me. <BR> I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne.
2941,I can't go on like this.  I can't....  I don't just sit around and watch people.  If I make a mistake it's all over.  You see it every day.  Do you want to see me taken away in pieces? <BR> I don't want to lose you.
2942,Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob. <BR> Come on Charlie. We got business. <BR> Couple hands. No harm in it.
2943,I been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved. I can't raise it on the radio either. Makes me think it might be in trouble. <BR> Alright. I'll be right up.
2944,Excuse me but I folded these things beautifully and I would appreciate a little respect. Jesus Christ! <BR> Don't look at me pal. I gotta live with her.
2945,Well there are certain sections of New York Major that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade. <BR> Aha. Who do you think will win the war? <BR> I haven't the slightest idea.
2946,What the hell were you doing rewriting my story-- <BR> --I sure couldn't hurt it could I?-- <BR> --it was fine the way it was-- <BR> --it was bullshit the way it was-- <BR> --I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?-- <BR> --what have you been here nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen-- <BR> --and you've had some fucking meteoric rise that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau-- <BR> --you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale-- <BR> --Bradlee went to Harvard-- <BR> --they're all the same all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart-- <BR> --I'm smart enough to know my story was solid-- <BR> --mine's better-- <BR> --no way-- <BR> --read 'em both and you'll see--
2947,My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman.  Right after he retires from the majors.  We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday. <BR> Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun. <BR> You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts. <BR> She's pretty special. <BR> Are you a good cop John? <BR> I try to be. <BR> Then I'll bet she's real proud of you huh? <BR> Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her. <BR> I'm sorry.  I didn't realize...  But she knew John.  A mother knows what's in her son's heart.
2948,What if I could prove it to you Satch? <BR> How's that? <BR> What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball. <BR> Frank please... <BR> The next batter Clendenon hits one outta the park. <BR> Frank this is insane... <BR> In the bottom of the 7th Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game Satch. <BR> Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?
2949,Sleep all right? <BR> Yes thanks. <BR> Good. More coffee?  Robert I hope you don't mind my asking but I feel like I should. <BR> What? <BR> Well these... women friends of yours... all over the world. How does it work? Do you see some of them again? Do you forget others? Do you write them now and then? How do you manage it?
2950,Well guess what? I found Betty... where she's been anyway. <BR> Where? Where is she? <BR> I'm not telling. <BR> What? <BR> I'm not telling 'til you straighten up. You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty... I mean it.

2961,What's he looking for? <BR> He said he has to find a perfect dozen. <BR> Perfect dozen. <BR> Each egg has to be perfect. <BR> The quest isn't going well? <BR> Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.
2962,Suzette will be back here any minute. <BR> When are you leaving Berlin? <BR> Very early in the morning. <BR> For Vienna? <BR> Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both. <BR> Oh -- yes but -- later. <BR> Why later? <BR> I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some. <BR> I'll give you what you need -- I have money. <BR> Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave? <BR> Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money? <BR> Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
2963,Listen did you want to make love? <BR> Make love? <BR> Have sex. Y'know -- <BR> Oh um... <BR> Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now. <BR> That's okay. I -- <BR> I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and -- <BR> Hey Joel -- <BR> -- and I'm just too nervous around you right now. <BR> I'm nervous too. <BR> Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that. <BR> Well you obviously don't know me. <BR> I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you.
2964,Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about - <BR> SHEILA!
2965,When do we bring'em back? <BR> You gotta give me a day.  I need a day.  He's sick get it out <u>now</u>.  Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  We got to get it out before the story breaks so we aren't quote responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin.  He's got some rare strain of... <BR> It won't hold. <BR> All I need is the one day. <BR> It won't even hold the one day Ronnie -- <BR> Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
2966,I guess it started back home. Wisconsin that is. There was just mum and dad - and me. I was the only child and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish aren't I? <BR> Not at all... <BR> Farmers were poor in those days that's what dad was - a farmer. I had to help out. So I quit school and I went to Milwaukee. I became a secretary. In a brewery.  When you're a secretary in a brewery - it's pretty hard to make believe you're anything else. Everything is beer. It wasn't much fun but it helped at home -  and there was a Little Theater Group... like a drop of rain in the desert. That's where I met Eddie. He was a radio technician. We played 'Liliom' for three performances I was awful - then the war came and we got married. Eddie was in the air force - and they sent him to the South Pacific. You were with the O.W.I. weren't you Mr. Richards?  That's what 'Who's Who' says... well with Eddie gone my life went back to beer. Except for a letter a week. One week Eddie wrote he had a leave coming up. I'd saved my money and vacation time. I went to San Francisco to meet him.  Eddie wasn't there. They forwarded the telegram from Milwaukee - the one that came from Washington to say that Eddie wasn't coming at all. That Eddie was dead...  ... so I figured I'd stay in San Francisco. i was alone but couldn't go back without Eddie. I found a job. And his insurance helped... and there were theaters in San Francisco. And one night Margo Channing came to play in 'Remembrance'... and I went to see it. And - well - here I am...
2967,I feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses. <BR> Get it while you're young.  And you better fix your lips.  You want to look nice for Osgood don't you?
2968,Too bad you didn't have a machine. <BR> There's two ways out I figger - over the roof but that's only one person maybe two. The other way is Under.
2969,There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen. <BR> Don't you dare you'll never hear from him again. <BR> Does Doug care that you're seventeen? <BR> Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him. <BR> If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen. <BR> Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
2970,You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose didn't you? <BR> If I say yes will you take your hand away? <BR> No. <BR> ...  yes.
2971,Me? What can I do? <BR> Gee I don't know Crabs...  Improvise. You're good at that.
2972,You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you. <BR> Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression. <BR> They said that? Really?  Oh your parents. The Nelson's. Right right. How midwest. I like that.
2973,How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox? <BR> Long as Charlie says.
2974,I don't like the word 'cheat.' <BR> Did you have affairs? <BR> Mr. Gittes. <BR> Did he know? <BR> Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone if that's what you mean.
2975,Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables wanna come? <BR> He never told me... <BR> You're just the President of the company what do you know? ... Come on.
2976,Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids. <BR> Sorry Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything. <BR> Okay cool. <BR> I'll try to drop by later.
2977,Hey Auggie. How's it going? <BR> Hey man. Good to see you. What'll it be today? <BR> Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it. <BR> The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there don't you think? <BR> Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth. <BR> The Queen of England? <BR> Not Elizabeth the Second Elizabeth the First.  Did you ever hear of Sir Walter Raleigh?
2978,I know.  I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight. <BR> Then you believe all this??  That Death is working off a list?
2979, <BR> Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been -- <BR> 
2980,What happened to him? <BR> I don't know. he moved away.
2981,I don't think that's funny. <BR> It wasn't meant to be. <BR> I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever... <BR> I hope you mean what you say Eve. I intend to hold you to it.
2982, <BR> Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you. <BR> People are only interested in you because you're famous not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.
2983,For what? <BR> Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito. <BR> What kind of business? <BR> Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors.
2984,All right now tell me about Johnnie. <BR> Johnnie? <BR> It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other. <BR> Like each other?  They hate each other. <BR> Why? <BR> It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father. <BR> Who is Gino?
2985,Jesus!  What the hell happened to him. <BR> Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
2986,I've tried to stop the evening papers but it's useless. <BR> You quit trying to stop anybody <BR> Well at best you might deny it. <BR> Why deny it? The more you deny the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut. <BR> Traps shut! <BR> Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself personally.  Now what are you crying about?
2987,The shark that did this.  It was a shark wasn't it? <BR> We don't know that do we? <BR> But that's what we're here to find out right? <BR> You don't tell me my job and I won't tell you about yours okay?
2988,Thank you very much. It's a pleasure. <BR> This is uh Shawn and uh... Bob and Petronia.
2989,You should have known better than to write Romeo. I found that out a long time ago. <BR> I should say you had. At the rate you two are going we'll have to leave the country to save our faces. <BR> Splendid Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face. <BR> Oh shut up!
2990,Okay you're sure about skipping Calculas? <BR> Please I have the perfect excuse. <BR> What about rehearsal? <BR> Gotta. <BR> I'll cover you through rehearsal. Derek when do you get outta docu- drama?
2991,Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies. <BR> Really? <BR> Stacy what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't one of the other girls will. <BR> He was hot wasn't he? <BR> If I didn't have a fiancé in Chicago I'd go for it.
2992,Glaser Safety Slugs? <BR> ...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor? <BR> Kevlar Second Chance. <BR> I hope you have a second chance... <BR> Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times' <BR> You got it. <BR> Let's walk the route.
2993,Why isn't Ruiz coming? <BR> This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller. <BR> What's that? <BR> A Shot Caller. A boss a Capo. He's running shit. <BR> Yeah.
2994,You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing did you? <BR> I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something. <BR> So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs Betty? <BR> Drugs? God no! I'm totally against drugs. <BR> Damn life is strange. I had you figured for this cold-blooded calculating bitch -- Not that I didn't admire you for it.
2995,You followed me. <BR> Orders. <BR> To kill me? <BR> Nothing personal.
2996,Look at yours. <BR> What? <BR> Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing. <BR> What are you talking about? <BR> It's like everything else in this place. You don't do it yourself it never gets done.
2997,I'm okay--I can walk. <BR> I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold. <BR> No--keep it down. I want to feel the air.
2998,Why do you stare at me like that? <BR> You remind me of someone I used to know.
2999,Jesus Jim! <BR> Sorry honey. Hell we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed. <BR> Just be careful. <BR> You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight eh? <BR> Tonight? Jim he's been out of it since he was born. <BR> Hell I guess he takes after me huh?
3000,Who is then? <BR> I don't know. Merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own. At first I did so because I feared Merlin later because I loved you.
3001,No. It's just trying to frighten us. <BR> It's succeeding! <BR> All the plates sealing the windows and doors -- there's got to be some way of raising them manually. They didn't just appear out of thin air -- there's got to be pulleys cables or something that make them go up and down.
3002,Go back inside! This is none of your business!  I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore. <BR> Hey. <BR> I'll to the FBI!
3003,You know I do. <BR> I know. <BR> So what do you say we shut off that light and get close huh?
3004,My quarters. <BR> Why is everything...like this? <BR> It's a flat. But wait a micro...
3005,Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately -- <BR> Guilty until proven innocent? <BR> Mother and Father know best.
3006,Now now Jack--that just ain't right. <BR> You just stay out of trouble Homer!
3007,You look fucking beautiful beautiful. <BR> Well thanks!
3008,Says you were closed off non communicative never told me what you were feeling. <BR> Says you were a bully... <BR> A bully? Moi? <BR> That's what it says. You drank too much you picked on me for being passive and timid. <BR> Well sounds like me. Sorry man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious. <BR> Says you would sometimes disappear all night then brag to me about your sexual conquests. <BR>  <BR> I don't know. <BR> Doesn't sound like me. <BR> Says you were a slob leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake. <BR> Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think? <BR> I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic. <BR> We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
3009,THE PLANE IN A VIOLENT RAINSTORM BUCKING WILDLY.  AMES ON HIS KNEES GATHERING UP THE PILLS REPLACES THEM IN THE VIAL SHAKES OUT TWO AND GIVES THEM TO SCHUMANN.  WHO TAKES THEM.  MOSS THEN STRAPS HIMSELF BACK IN AND BREAN CONTINUES TALKING ON THE TELEPHONE. <BR> You gonna git me back tomorrow?  Cause they havin <u>beans</u> tomorrow...
3010,Going somewhere Margie? <BR> I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat. <BR> Don't lie to me. You're leaving me I can see that. <BR> Don't be silly. Hi Jill.
3011,College was entertaining Wichita but after 40 days and 40 nights of this I really think we're going to get to know each... <BR> Ooh look time to confiscate my first water balloon...
3012,You know what you just signed Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie an illusion.  You see?  In the end you were the one who abandoned me... <BR> No...
3013,I'm half Irish. <BR> I don't fuck with those crazy off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
3014,I've never been under the table before. <BR> Lookdirt! <BR> That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation. <BR> Looks like dirt.
3015,Where's Emily Hank? <BR> I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that Grady. <BR> I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just... want to know where I stand.
3016,I was asleep Mr. President.  What can I get you? <BR> Just ... uh ... you know. <BR> Of course.
3017,A million deaths are not enough for Yueh... <BR>  Where are my feelings... I feel for no one...
3018,Tessie they say you were the sister with personality. <BR> I was a great beauty. <BR> Uh how did this personality come about? <BR> I was very charming. <BR> There were many men interested in you? <BR> Oh I was quite a lively dancer.
3019,I thought it'd be nicer to eat here. <BR> Sounds good. <BR> I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it. <BR> Yeah those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
3020,Right. Well thanks. For the lift. <BR> No sweat. Only do me a favor? <BR> Sure. <BR> Stop calling me Vernon.
3021,You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman. <BR> No. <BR> Or her name? <BR> No.
3022,How's he doing? <BR> Same. Any luck? <BR> No. I'll try again later.
3023,Hello Bud. <BR> Gordon. <BR> You sandbagged me on Bluestar.  I guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson that you can make the tail wag the dog huh?
3024,What's  the matter now? <BR> Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this. <BR> It must be just so pathetic being you. Sure Billy grab your dog we'll eat in the van.
3025,Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is. <BR> I can't Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.
3026,Yeah the lot's right there. My truck is right out back. <BR> But not flush against the tunnel?
3027,Hi-iii... <BR> Hi.  Where've you been? <BR> Sightseeing...  What're you doing? <BR> Packing. <BR> Why? <BR> Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase. <BR> So you've had a little bad luck. <BR> A little bad luck? <BR> Okay a lot of bad luck.  But that means the odds are probably in your favor now.  This is no time to give up.
3028,This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression. <BR> Ch... <BR> To customers approaching the bank from the rear <BR> Right. <BR> You can see why it's sensitive? <BR> Uh... Yes.
3029,I don't wear a white wig I don't carry a gavel. <BR> That's a good idea maybe I will!
3030,So what's going on Joel? <BR> I don't know I've just been thinking maybe we're not happy with each other. <BR> What? <BR> Y'know we've been I don't know sort of unhappy with each other and -- <BR>  <BR> I think maybe we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy both have to be... by definition. <BR> Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone. <BR> No. I just need some space maybe. <BR> The thing is Joel whatever it is you think you have with this chick once the thrill wears off you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems. <BR> It's not somebody else.
3031,No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing. <BR> For who? <BR> For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life. <BR> Then he can move! People move! <BR> His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids... <BR> The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you. <BR> No they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her? <BR> What about us? What about me? <BR> You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change. <BR> Yeah. It could get better. <BR> No matter how much distance we put between us and this house I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake. <BR> Francesca listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage alone in a town you hate in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!? <BR> We are the choices we've made Robert. <BR> TO HELL WITH YOU!
3032,You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless... <BR> What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
3033,God. you scared me. <BR> Is something wrong? What's happened to your face? <BR> Nothing. I'm fine. <BR> You can't just stay out half the night and carry on Jeffrey. There's got to be some order Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
3034,You were never invited to my house. <BR> You're looking for a urine sample.
3035,Hey dudes... Aren't you supposed to go to church Kenny? <BR> Kyle check it out.
3036,"I think maybe we oughta... <BR> Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all..."
3037,So ... how's the food over there in China Mr. Nixon? <BR> Free if you're the president.
3038,And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk. <BR> I have a class. I'm late. <BR> Can we talk later? Will you be at the party? <BR> I'm not sure.
3039,Speak of the devil. <BR> They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out. <BR> Good! We'll get it to the nearest outlying station and hold it for prints - we're on our way -  You coming?
3040,You looking for me? <BR> Looking for you? Yes. <BR> What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it? <BR> We just wanted to speak to you.
3041,That's lovely. <BR> Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to -- <BR> It's fine Mary. I'm happy to hear it. <BR> Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
3042,Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change. <BR> I'm not getting a ticket.
3043,...four years ago... <BR> Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello... <BR> I need a cigarette!  She left my office four years ago we're looking for a chart...  I need a cigarette...
3044,Like cattle... <BR> You're saying they can think? <BR> I'm saying they're calling the shots...
3045,Brad I really fuckin' hate McDonald's man. Ever since they started in with the chicken everything went downhill. <BR> You want to work at Carl's? <BR> Oh man if you could swing something there I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys. <BR> I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor. <BR> All right!!
3046,You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to. <BR> I guess I wanted to. <BR> I'm glad you did. <BR> So am I.
3047,Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it. <BR> Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health? <BR> Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station. <BR> What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now look I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me. <BR> I told you I didn't want to mix in it. <BR> All right brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place and I don't mean California.
3048,I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy? <BR> Yeah. Cool. <BR>  <BR> Very cool. Trippy. <BR> I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful important things.
3049,Bloody hell... <BR> We can't... stay here.  That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.
3050,It's not going to help us! <BR> We're going to die here! We're going to die!
3051,Watch out man. Sorry. I'm on the list man.  Hey bro. <BR> The line's over there. <BR> Yeah but we're good. You know what I mean? <BR> How is it you're good? You on a list? <BR> Yeah. Ricky Slade. <BR> You see a Ricky Slade?
3052,Can I go swimming? <BR> No.  Find your brother okay?
3053,Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy. <BR> Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...
3054,Jefferies. <BR> This is Doyle Jeff. <BR> Tom I've got something real big for you. <BR> Look Jeff don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be -- <BR> Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested. <BR> Your Lisa? <BR> My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police. <BR> I told you that -- <BR> I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence and she came out with it. <BR> Like what? <BR> Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive she'd be wearing it. <BR> A possibility. <BR> A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent. <BR> Like an old hambone? <BR> I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions because they're up in his apartment now! <BR>  <BR> In sections! And one other thing doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived? <BR> Where'd they take Lisa? <BR> Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money. <BR> Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down Jeff.
3055,Sandy you scared the shit out of me. <BR> What are you doing? <BR> Just thought I'd stop by. <BR> Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there. <BR> Yeah. <BR> Are you his girlfriend? <BR> No.
3056,Well...? <BR> Something like thirty-six. <BR> WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX? <BR> Lower your voice! <BR>  <BR> Um. Thirty-seven. <BR> I'M THIRTY-SEVEN? <BR> I'm going to class. <BR> Thirty-seven?!  My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks!
3057,Mary people come to him voluntarily. <BR> I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book. <BR> The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased. <BR> Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo! <BR> Mary... please. This is hurting people.
3058,And you struck him right here in our house? <BR> Yes I'm sorry I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
3059,Listen copper get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant. <BR> What do you think I am? <BR> Whatever you are you're the only one of it. <BR> It happens that I'm the law. <BR> How quaint. But I can go any place you can. 
3060,It feels really... good... here. <BR> I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
3061,So you'll call me right? <BR> Yeah. <BR> When? <BR> Tomorrow? <BR> Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines. <BR> Yeah.
3062,It's an appearance. It has nothing to do with support. I don't even like him. <BR> Bill he's a crazy man.
3063,-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car. <BR> Hector don't interrupt me. <BR> He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car. <BR> I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
3064,"I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow. <BR> How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death? <BR> I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day. <BR> Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury? <BR> Yeah. And your meter just ran out."
3065,One of mom's cups got broken. <BR> I'm sorry.  At least we're in on piece.
3066,Why's that? <BR> Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find. <BR> It's the Irish tape we want. <BR> Gonna be tough.
3067,I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them. <BR> Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint. <BR> That's ridiculous! No one's that powerful.
3068,What was that? <BR> Nothing. <BR> Someone's back there. <BR> Hey! Come out here!
3069,That was lovely. <BR> Will you do me a big favor? <BR> I'll do anything for you. <BR> Would you like to make a man happy? <BR> Yes -- I'd love to. <BR> Then dance the next number with Kringelein. <BR> Why? <BR> I feel sorry for him. <BR> You're not a bit like you were yesterday. <BR> I fell in love last night -- the real thing. <BR> Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist. <BR> I thought that too -- but I found that it does. Come along dance with Kringelein. <BR> Anything for you.
3070,"Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever. <BR> Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan... <BR> You were born old..."
3071,Right uhh... I feel terrible about this we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come. <BR> Yeah bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
3072,Why is this putz on the air... <BR> ... they're checking the ratings...uh...
3073,Hey house is doin' well.  Hey all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant. <BR> No that's quite all right.
3074,Illegal surveillance reckless endangerment... <BR> Attempted murder.
3075,What's gotten into you Sheriff?  I was -- <BR> YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
3076,Okay. <BR> What is it? <BR> Just some fatherly advice.
3077,I get it. <BR> Tell me. <BR> Don't worry. I get it. <BR> So tell me how it is. <BR> You want... Why are you picking on me? <BR> Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you.
3078,They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo. Some kind of statement. <BR> Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago. And threatened him several times since. President Clear Moon and the regional FBI feel he made good on that threat.
3079,You really mean that?  What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy Darien... <BR> You're not exactly pure Bud you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before... <BR> I'm looking...and I sure don't like what I see.
3080,Ya know you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that. <BR> Me an' you both.
3081,I keep wanting to do that -- fling open the door -- let the light in clean everything out. If I could get a huge eraser and rub everything out... starting with myself... the thing is Peter if... <BR> No key huh?
3082,What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in? <BR> Smart girl. <BR> Smart? She'll be arrested! <BR> That'll get her out of there won't it?
3083,Well I had a really good day you know that? It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday. <BR> Ah? Oh well your birthday's not till tomorrow honey I hate to tell yuh. <BR> Yeah but it's real close. <BR> Yeah but no presents till midnight. <BR> Oh darn it.
3084,...where's my l'il <u>pill</u>? <BR> Show some compassion.
3085,... Stan I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million. <BR> Now come on here no way Wade!  No way!
3086,Oh come Madam -- please come.  <BR> All right Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
3087,Who said they left then? <BR> Who left -- where? <BR> The Thorwalds -- at six in the morning?
3088,Believe me Buddy I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien... <BR> ...I can't make it tonight. <BR> Are you with me Buddy?
3089,Ray there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation. <BR> It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit. <BR> The main problem is Ray these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable. <BR> Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The Indians don't like white cops poking around. And that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent.
3090,I'm going to make myself a drink if that's okay? <BR> Go right ahead sir.
3091,Suck my balls. <BR> Yeah  <b>Shut your fucking face Unclefucka!!</b>
3092,Argento's good but Lewis is completely demented. We're talking buckets of goo. Red corn syrup everywhere. And fake brains up the yin-yang. <BR> Frankly this looks kind of stupid.
3093,We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us? <BR> Oh darling of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough Mother will give us the blue room too I think. <BR> Oh Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room have you?  Well bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it wouldn't she? <BR> But we don't need it I'm sure. <BR> I see we won't need that. Plenty of room plenty of room.
3094,The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room making marks on his blackboard. <BR> I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.
3095,You've done a really great job with the house.  It's great! <BR> Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look he hasn't even come in for his food today. <BR> So you don't have anything concrete? <BR> No I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt. <BR> Have you just plain asked him? <BR> I've asked him what's wrong. <BR> And? <BR> The same thing -- his business pressures the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job worried about screwing over his present boss. <BR> I'm sure that's all it is honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation. <BR> I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately. <BR> Don't drive yourself crazy.  It's probably nothing.
3096,What's the hurry? <BR> A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley. <BR> Huh? <BR> I figured you already heard. <BR> Twombley Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon you drive. We'll take my truck.
3097,Is Mr Greenleaf here? <BR> Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
3098,What's going on? <BR> You weren't around when I woke up I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job Sam and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you...
3099,Had to.  To keep him still for the trip. <BR> You've broken its leg! <BR> We've got to transport it seven thousand miles.  Would you prefer it bit off the leg of a crew member?
3100,What do you mean? <BR> Do you know where I found this?
3101,I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles. <BR> ...You-you spoke to him? <BR> Not in the strict sense of the word no. He was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted in acid when I caught up with him later.
3102,This is Elmer our longest serving... <BR> Hey.  Let's junk the medals Elmer.  This is not a Veterans' reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home.  Not remind him of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.
3103,Wheee!  Faster! <BR> How fast is enough? <BR> I want to go faster!
3104,What the hell are you kids doing down here? <BR> What do you think we're doing dad? <BR> What do I think? I think you're probably touching each other. I think you're touching that reckless jerk-off for god's sake and I think he's trying to get into your slacks. I think at fourteen years of age that you're getting ready to give up your girlhood --
3105,That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap. <BR> It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
3106,"Then again why should she be? I mean with us with our... <BR> So maybe you'll come too? <BR> Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems why can't you just come out and talk about them. <BR> It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say and I'm waiting to hear back from you. <BR> Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that I'm OK. You're OK"""" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject and --"" <BR> -- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision -- <BR> Elena."
3107,You got a look in your eye Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry... <BR> Jesus can't make a buck in this market country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it.
3108,Give me a tremendous laugh here Charlie. <BR> Look uh...
3109,Hello McCoy. <BR> Beynon. <BR> News said two persons killed.
3110,You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down. <BR> No that's not I couldn't... <BR> Listen when someone does the kind of thing you did you gotta do something in return. So you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?
3111,Tell me did he kill his little victims too? <BR> No!
3112,The passionate one? <BR> Yes. <BR> Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow. <BR> I count my blessings. <BR> Well I guess I'll be seeing you.
3113,I'm going to Paris. <BR> <u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down. <BR> You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think. <BR> You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off. <BR> I can't call it off.  He's not responding.  Get out of my way.
3114,"About ready for another drink? <BR> Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention? <BR> Do I look that obvious? My name's Paul."
3115,Mr. President! <BR> It's okay Bob we're just rapping my friends and I.  We actually agree on a lot of things ...
3116,Added to which indignity I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk Johnny Unitas or something. <BR> The shit they pull huh?
3117,...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But Jesus Nicky was the worst thing she could've done. <BR> What if he won't stop? <BR> I mean it could get us both killed. <BR> I can back him off.
3118,How are you -- is it Joe? <BR> Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago. <BR> Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night Jeff. <BR> Oh Professor Tripp? You know last semester what I said that time in office hours -- I hope there's no hard feelings. <BR> No... <BR> I mean I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general. <BR> It's cool Jeff. Really. <BR> I just want you to know that's why I dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo- Faulknerian nobody.
3119,What are you making such a big deal about?  They're only lobsters. Look you're a grown man you know how to pick up a lobster. <BR> I'm not myself since I stopped smoking. <BR> Oh when'd you quit smoking?
3120,Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep.  All Englishmen are ugly. <BR> What makes you say that? <BR> All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson turn out to be Irish.  Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh.  Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors. <BR> Richard Burton was very good-looking. <BR> Welsh. <BR> Sean Connery.
3121,Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?  Are you God? <BR> No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...
3122,Promise me it'll always be like that. <BR> Like what? <BR> When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything. <BR> Um... okay.
3123,What he means is it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind. <BR> Yeah but you gotta know what it's about right? I mean if you didn't know what it was about why were you writing it?
3124,I think you'd better go. <BR> Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion and
3125,But they're not destroyed not yet. <BR> Do we really need to repair this fort?  It seems like an expensive undertaking.  I propose we burn it to the ground.  That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.
3126,Um I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not you know set in stone. <BR> What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you? <BR> No no I don't think that Juno. It's just that we went through a situation before where it didn't work out.
3127,Scully -- <BR> I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.
3128,Now have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother. <BR> This is a complicated case your Honor... <BR> I'm sure it is Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop? <BR> My client can't walk your Honor. <BR> I know full well she can't Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket. You follow me? I'm trying to help you.
3129,Arrest them! <BR> What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this! <BR> Rouen is in English territory.  I have the right to do anything I like.  Take them away.
3130,You're from out of town? <BR> Yes. I'm cutting a record. <BR> We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come. <BR> Is there food? <BR> No. <BR> Well I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything. <BR> No those are socials you're thinking of... Saturday's usually.
3131,Continental Casualty... <BR> Mr. Alito please. <BR> Business hours are over Sir. This is the switch... <BR> I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number? <BR> I'm sorry Sir we're not allowed... <BR> ...Would you would you call him up. I'll give you my number and ask him... <BR> I can't guarantee that... <BR> I understand. Thank you my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent.
3132,Red Deer Table Ray. <BR> Don't tell me: heavy duty. <BR> Heavy heavy duty. Taku Wakan. Wanagi Spirits. It's one of those few places we'd never go to as kids. Still don't. Some of the old people say Crazy Horse is buried back there. We have to go Ray. Together. Like his vision.
3133,I think you gotta hit them straight on! <BR> Got it...
3134,What are you doing? <BR> Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
3135,"She's gonna steal that kid for her collection. <BR> Right, seriously."
3136,She makes ten. <BR> Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women. <BR> What're you talking'?  You know better than anybody John.  You've read this file a thousand times.
3137,"Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once! <BR> I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately. <BR>  <BR> Keith's hot. <BR> Eww he's all beardy!"
3138,I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown trying to talk this psycho inside? <BR> Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No you never told me that story. <BR> No you never listened. I was going man if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down there was a part of me that wanted to go with him. <BR> Make a left here. I want to stop.
3139,DEATH!! <BR> I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go? <BR> Fine thanks. Saw my girl said goodbye everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> I guess I'm yours now.
3140,It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond. <BR> Thank you Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding? <BR> My mother and I used to ride a lot before she got sick. <BR> I'm sorry about that. <BR> My Grandpa used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time. <BR> I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name? <BR> Ben Schwarz. <BR> Schwarz. Jewish? <BR> German. <BR> Doesn't ring a bell.
3141,"You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken? <BR> Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong-- <BR> She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you? <BR> That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas. <BR> Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen? <BR> Where?  What do you mean, where? <BR> Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant-- <BR> --I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment."
3142,Meanwhile what happens to the country? <BR> The bastard!  If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won.  He made me look soft.
3143,Good morning. <BR> You think this shit's funny Ho? <BR> Nah man... <BR> You think it's funny motherfucker?
3144,"What's wrong? <BR> It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind. <BR> What do you mean? <BR> I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over. <BR> I'll be right there."
3145,It's not a long drive. An hour an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner. <BR> We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
3146,"God, why is everyone always staring at me? <BR> Well, you are kind of... convex."
3147,"I'm giving her a very high-class party. It ain't like a rehearsal, she don't have to be late. <BR> As soon as the peasants stop pawing her."
3148,Right here...middle of nowhere... <BR> And where is our point of arrival?
3149,Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler? <BR> The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem and therefore how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building for example that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently if necessary.
3150,Okay. Airports train stations bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond. <BR> Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
3151,--and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President. <BR> No none of those.
3152,They need the money for my band uniform at school. <BR> I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore. <BR> I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes you know so I thought maybe I'd stay in. <BR> Well I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days. Maybe after dinner.
3153,Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters. <BR> Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open you might as well take advantage of me.
3154,They don't have the package. <BR> You think? <BR> You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead. If they had the package they'd have killed him.
3155,I take it your son is called Leon? <BR> Leonard. What my daughter is on about Mr Lombard is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that...
3156,Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy. <BR> What's this what's this?!
3157,Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you of course -- from Marge and Dickie. <BR> No glasses.
3158,I bring a message from Garcia. <BR> Yeah? <BR> Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune. <BR> Yeah - go on. <BR> It's all right. You can write your own ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a week. <BR> I'll bite. What's the catch? <BR> There's no catch. This is on the up and up. Of course all you have to do is just sign the article - by Anne Schuyler's Husband.
3159,Hi! <BR> Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you. <BR> Right... OK...
3160,I don't want to devalue your victory but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win. <BR> Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges. <BR> You learn that in your psychotherapy group? <BR> Discussion group Alex discussion.
3161,We should go. <BR> We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her. <BR> It's a very moving experience trust me. <BR> No. <BR> One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World. <BR> No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night? <BR> What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City or Houston or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty. <BR> I said 'No.' N-O.
3162,Will we see a worm? <BR> Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms. <BR> Always? <BR> Always. <BR> Why do they come? <BR> To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. -- PAUL  I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things.  Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?
3163,Hey? <BR> H'm? <BR> I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books I think because I-I think you should read them. You know instead of that cat book. <BR> That's uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there. <BR> Yeah 'cause I-I'm you know I'm I'm obsessed with-with uh with death I think. Big- <BR> Yeah? <BR> big subject with me yeah. <BR> Yeah?
3164,Be cool man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen.  Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out? <BR> Stressed? He's psycho.
3165,He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance In the mirrors.  I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important. <BR> 'Changes?' <BR> It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again... <BR> VTR film Polaroid stills what? <BR> How do I know?!
3166,Hey-- <BR> What? <BR> Nice dress. <BR> Thank you Peter.  Thank you so much.
3167,On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here.  The Senate may be vacillating but I have the army behind me.  I'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort. <BR> I can't let you do that.
3168,It won't hold. <BR> One day Two days?  <u>Course</u> it's gonna hhhh....
3169,Hey. Where's Monkeybone? <BR> Back in your head where he belongs. <i></i> No offense Stu but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him. <BR> Back? You're sending me back? <BR>  <BR> Death! Thank you! <BR> Thank me next time you see me.
3170,What? <BR> Abbott wants to talk. <BR> Tell him we're busy. <BR> I tried.

It'll go here. <BR> The Valley? <BR> Everything you can see everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you? <BR> No. <BR> In the last three months Robert Knox has bought 7000 acres Emma Dill 12000 acres Clarence Speer 5000 acres and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25000 acres. <BR> Jasper Lamar Crabb? <BR> Know him? <BR> No I think I'd remember. <BR> Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid. <BR> And Hollis knew about it? <BR> It's why he was killed. Jasper Lamar Crabb. Jasper Lamar Crabb.
3175,"What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time! <BR> It just didn't fit her profile... <BR> Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!! <BR> She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her... <BR> ...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind... <BR> ...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a... <BR> I do not know how the fuck you lasted an hour in this job! Dragging our asses around with the answer to our prayers in your motherfucking jacket... a picture of that cunt right next to the..."
3176,There's this guy! <BR> What? <BR> There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him. <BR> Really? Is he cute? <BR> He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased! <BR> Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm like so freaked out now.
3177,You thought that up all by yourself huh? <BR> Why it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that <BR> Personally I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object. <BR> Oh no. She'll be crazy about it. Well see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye.  <BR> We've done that already. <BR> Yes of course.

3181,All the more reason!  I don't want you - with all due respect Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up. <BR> The heck d'ya mean? <BR> They want my money they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional.  He points at a briefcase. <BR> ...There's a million dollars here! <BR> No see - <BR> Look Jerry you're not sellin' me a damn car. It's my show here.  That's that.

3185,So... everything sounds... wonderful? <BR> Yes it is. <BR> Then... why are you here so often? <BR> I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him. <BR> Him? <BR> Well I try and talk to him but mostly he's the one who does the talking. <BR>  <BR> He never says his name. <BR> What... does he... look like?
3186,Who called this meeting? <BR> Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.
3187,A fire! Is this your idea of humor my friend? <BR> I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap. <BR> You are asking to burn these people ... you are asking? ...

That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago I met this guy -- <BR> Oh my God you're having an affair.
3190,Theo Buzz is dead. <BR> I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me. <BR> Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila. <BR> I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter and mounts it. <BR> Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out. <BR> SSHHEEIILLAAA!
3191,But we had it!  We were headed right for it! <BR> Shit.  Shit shit shit!
3192,Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty like ripping off a Band-Aid. <BR> Well then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved then? <BR> Shit yeah. Close it up.

3195,Uh hi Su-Chin. <BR> Oh hi Juno. How are you? <BR> Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet? <BR> No not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night but I'm having trouble concentrating. <BR> You should try Adderall. <BR> No thanks. I'm off pills. <BR>  <BR> I heard that was you. <BR> Well it was nice seeing you.
3196,See that. They're gone! <BR> Looks like it don't it?  Here's the woman ma. <BR> Oh!!
3197,"I'm very sorry about that. I apologize. <BR> I accept. Now get out. <BR> Get out? We had an arrangement. <BR> Didn't you hear what I said? <BR> I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy. <BR> Get out! <BR> I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed. <BR> And if I don't? <BR> Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three. <BR> I think you have your answer. <BR> War it is."
3198,No I don't. <BR> That's good. They're allowed but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one. <BR> I can hardly wait Coco.
3199,If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no. <BR> She shot you down. <BR> Exactly the opposite. <BR> So what went wrong? <BR> I don't know. She was lying on the bed ready to do it but I-- I don't I was... I just didn't feel right about it. <BR> You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump. <BR> A momentary lapse of judgment soon to be rectified.
3200,Tell me. <BR> I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but - <BR> Yeah no shit.
3201,Alvy let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart. <BR> Oh no no I think we're both much too mature for something like that. <BR> Living together hasn't been so bad has it? <BR> It's all right for me it's been terrific you know?

Just watch out for those buck teeth. <BR> Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this! <BR>  <BR> Honey I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>. <BR> There <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.
3224,You're saying they mutinied for the gold? <BR> If they were close enough to shore they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats. <BR> Only something must've gone wrong.
3225,How many fucking sources they think we got?-- <BR> --Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone but he's scared of Haldeman. <BR> I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury.  <BR> --We got twenty minutes to deadline--

3236,I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married. <BR> Be more specific. <BR> In English.  I'll fuck your brains out. <BR> What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car. <BR> Because I'm the only person you can't control and it kills you.
3237,Hello Freddie it's Tom Tom Ripley. <BR> Oh hello where's Dickie? How are you? <BR> Yes I'm good thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it? <BR> I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth. <BR> I guess. <BR> The landlady -- as far as I could tell the landlady said he was here right now. <BR> He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you. <BR> Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas? <BR> What about Christmas? <BR> He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or frankly a fart.
3238,"That's it! Radio in for help! <BR> Shut up! Just pump her out! <BR> Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call."

3240,Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward.  Let him take a few teeth... <BR> A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
3241,But I thought you'd be cool if... <BR> I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen once I have the baby Vanessa is going to finally be happy and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one! <BR> A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides I don't know if I'm ready to be a father. <BR> But you're old! <BR> I... How do you think of me Juno? Why are you here? <BR> I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life. <BR> This...  ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you? <BR> Yeah I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me? <BR> That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore. <BR> Yeah but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once you can love them again I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy like four times. You're just not trying.
3242,What's up? Jess ready? <BR> You driving her? <BR> Yeah. <BR> She'll be out in a minute.
3243,We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ... <BR> Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb. <BR> Impossible.
3244,So none of us knows who's paying the freight this is just some anonymous job. For all we know we're working for different people. <BR> Now that is an interesting proposition.
3245,I'm not going with them. <BR> James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough something bad is going to happen trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand? <BR> I'm not going with them. <BR> James like it or not they're your parents. <BR> Parents? They're not my parents. They're my grandparents. My parents are dead.
3246,No money no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you? <BR> Well where to begin.  It's complicated... <BR> It always is.
3247,A full night on the street and this is all? <BR> Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
3248,Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return? <BR> If the nest is upwind so are we. When he comes back he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
3249,Nope. <BR> He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
3250,- with stupid braces on your teeth. <BR> Okay then. <BR> Every time I ever see you that's what I see. <BR> Uh talk to you later.  Bye. 
3251,Thanks for the lift. <BR> I'll come inside with you if you like but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone. <BR> That's right. <BR> There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS. <BR> Thanks.
3252,Either you are incredibly brave or incredibly stupid. Which one is it? <BR> I guess we're going to find out. <BR> You rob an associate of mine... a friend and-- <BR> Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?
3253,Such a bargain. But that is your decision? <BR> I'm sorry. It is.
3254,Read some good books. <BR> I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore. <BR> I'll send you some comic books. <BR> Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic. <BR> Like what? <BR> I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere. <BR> It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man. <BR> Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry the electric dishwasher the garbage disposal and a nagging wife. <BR> Jeff -- wives don't nag anymore -- they discuss.
3255,Lemme go! I didn't go to do it! <BR> Keep qui'te will ya! Shet your mouth! <BR> I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string! <BR> Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here.

What in the name of God have you been doing Jason? <BR> I don't know. <BR> They're right about you aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on do you? <BR> I know you've been trying to kill me. <BR> Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble. <BR> So now you know. <BR> So it's time to go home. <BR> That's all I get? <BR> We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that. <BR> I don't think so. <BR> We have to go home Jason. <BR> Jason Bourne is dead. <BR> <u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you... <BR> Keep it.  <BR> Jason...  They can't let you go... <BR> That'll be their second worst mistake.

3277,Did you hear about that bowler who got smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out of the alley. I heard he was kacked but good. They had to take apart the pin machine to get him out. <BR> The pin machine? <BR> Just like Junior did the last time; lane six. All's I know is it's gonna be a closed coffin. My advice to you is to lay low. He puts on a pair of dark 7-Eleven shades flips up his collar and skulks away.

3299,Goodnight. <BR> I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name. <BR> The maitre d' called you Christine. <BR> Right.  Call me Christy. <BR> Goodnight Christy.  It was nice meeting you. <BR> Give me an address so I can send your shirt back. <BR> Keep it.
3300,Sam Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot. <BR> I like it fine here. <BR> He'll double what I pay you. <BR> Yeah but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here. <BR> Sorry.
3301, <BR> Nobody says you have to be like me. <BR> He does. <BR> You don't give him enough credit Chas.
3302,You okay? <BR> Yeah. <BR> I'm sorry about what I said. <BR> Said what? <BR> About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian? <BR> Forget it. <BR> I'm sorry. <BR> I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
3303,So what's he doing? You believe him? <BR> It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear... <BR> Well whatever he's doing I've had enough -- this is now a search and destroy mission.  I want the Berlin police fully briefed and --  -- get this out to all the agencies.
3304,He's not there.  But look what I found in his room <BR> Is it real? <BR> Looks real to me.
3305,What the fuck did you do that for? <BR> Two reasons: one I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines. <BR> Jesus! <BR> And two to make a point: title does not dictate behavior. <BR> What? <BR> If title dictated my behavior as a clerk serving the public I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence even though I'm a clerk in this video store I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed? <BR> You're a danger to both the dead and the living. <BR> I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny. <BR> Please get the hell out of here. <BR> I know I'm your hero.
3306,Well I'm done.  Are you done? <BR> No -- <BR> Okay let's go. <BR> But --
3307,Don't 'easy Ruiz' me. Y'all turned a Easter egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon.  Bring me four eggs Benedict and a mimosa. You all want mimosas? <BR> Nah man...
3308,No we didn't. <BR> Oh yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
3309,You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ... <BR> But I had to. It was the only way to get to you --
3310,No.  No you go ahead. <BR> You sure you'll be okay? <BR> I'm sure.  And Kate thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend. <BR> I'll be back before you leave.
3311,Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open. <BR> How come you took so much interest in her Dr. Darling?
3312,This is ridiculous. <BR> Government cutbacks. <BR> Why can't we do it through the mail? <BR> We missed the deadline. <BR> Can't we do it on the phone? <BR> I don't think so.
3313,Did you know my father? <BR> Oh yeah sure. He killed a cop right?
3314,You can't do this!  You owe me O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you! <BR> That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
3315,I really hate to bother him but... <BR> Oh no no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
3316,How much money is involved? <BR> A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot... <BR> They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot right? They don't waste time... <BR> I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it? <BR> No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome. <BR> Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive. <BR> Then get a large cash advance. <BR> Right right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this. <BR> Before they leave get gold. <BR> Right right what am I thinking of? <BR> I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink. <BR> I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die but for you -- anything!
3317,I knew you'd come back. <BR> I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
3318,Hey I need a room. Need a room. <BR> Good to see ya.  William would you...
3319,We will always love most that which we create.  Don't you agree Susan? <BR> Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb?
3320,Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved. <BR> The Institute ... the funding ... <BR> A cover ... for us.  I'm sorry...
3321,It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk. <BR> Spare me. <BR> I figure it's karma. You wronged me and you wronged your wife and you wronged your children so this is karma biting you on the ass or in your case...  ...on the eye.
3322,Heyyou not up yet? Come oncome on! <BR> What time is it? <BR> Eight o'clock.
3323,What one has to do Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action. <BR> ...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO <u>Shreds</u>. <BR> If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days til the election we... <BR> Yeah hut you can't hold the dam.  How the hell n'nu'n' I don't get what you want <u>me</u> to ...
3324,When I left here with the money... <BR> Mm. <BR> ...I got muscled on the street. <BR> Mm. <BR> A couple of guys I owe them. So that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did. <BR> Yeah? <BR> Yeah. <BR> You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin' low-life motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?
3325,"You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'... <BR> Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious..."
3326,I got kicked out. Well not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave. <BR> I guess there's probably a story behind that. <BR> There is but it's not that interesting. <BR> So where have you been staying? <BR> The bus station.
3327,So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too don't -- <BR> -- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window took aim -- missed once hitting the shitter -- fired again and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell rolled and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold.  Electromagnetic printing.
3328,Dad I really think we should call the cops. <BR> No! We can't let anyone know about this thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman he'll tell ya the same thing! <BR> Yeah but - <BR> We're gonna get Mom back for ya but we gotta play ball. Ya know that's the deal. Now if Lorraine calls or Sylvia you just say that Mom is in Florida with Pearl and Marty...
3329,I told you! I told you you couldn't trust him! He's gone! <BR> Who? <BR> That feller last night that's who! He was gonna stay a week huh? Well he's skipped. Took the car with him too. We wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if I hadn't took that magnesia.  Come on get up don't lay there. Let's do something about it.
3330,Ow ow fuckity-ow. Bren when do I get that Spinal Tap thing? <BR> It's called a spinal block and you can't have it yet honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough. <BR> You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now? <BR> Well honey doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
3331,Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place. <BR> Does Dorothy know her husband is dead? <BR> Not yet. <BR> Oh my God. Is her son OK?
3332,They're watching. <BR> Wha... ? <BR> Not here!  They can see.
3333,"Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid! <BR> I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan..."
3334,What's this? <BR> Nothing. <BR> I know what it is. <BR> Then why did you ask me? <BR> I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office. <BR> They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
3335,How long? <BR> Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands. <BR> If out plan works...the FBI will get rid of it for us.
3336,Good-bye Arthur.  Homer I'll see you tomorrow? <BR> Right.
3337,Look... search your own records if you prefer. You can do it a lot faster than us anyway. If we find Buffalo Bill through your information I'll suppress it. Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated. <BR> I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building and a funny nose? <BR> Oh that's clever Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me just as fast as you can then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order We'll ask twice a day just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson over at Johns Hopkins and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats when the next one floats and the next one - why we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks. <BR> It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you. <BR> Would you Doctor? That would be so kind.
3338,And this is Stacy. <BR> Stacy.  <BR> This is Nick. <BR> Pleasure.
3339,How bad is it? <BR> It's bad. Before you even showed up he said you were Maxie's 'token goons' and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing. <BR> When's it going down? <BR> Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now who knows? <BR> Shit.
3340,We are so alike Xavier. Still sometimes I wonder which one of us is the ugliest. <BR> If you can send me a receipt.
3341,Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  I think Suzette I have never been so tired in my life.  Veronal didn't even help me to sleep.  <BR> Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
3342,I-i-i-i-it's all right fellas.  Jesus what'd you do come by way of the Panama Canal? <BR> Alright alright I'm in a bad mood okay?
3343,Lancelot how did you fare in the North? <BR> We spared the lives of a few so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights...
3344,Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal you know off the car body rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta you know but they didn't find it right away so the guy's losin' a lot of blood you know to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself he said while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is. <BR> Find out who they are? <BR> Nope not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere. <BR> Interesting. <BR> Yeah ... and they both use the same address. <BR> Where at? <BR> Palmdale. <BR> Damn that's a long drive.
3345,I'm sorry. <BR> Why? <BR> Why what? <BR> Why are you sorry? I just said hi. <BR> No I didn't know if you were talking to me so...
3346,Hey Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here'] <BR> I'll be right out. <BR> T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy?  <BR> Mm. <BR> Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us so keep a good eye on him. <BR> Mm. <BR> Not like your fuckin' friends out there that... without brains.  Okay? <BR> All right. <BR> Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you'] <BR> Yeah. <BR> Fine. <BR> Want me to take this for you? 
3347,Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor. <BR> With pleasure Madame! <BR> Get out of here.
3348,Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that. <BR> Haldeman.  Right? <BR> I won't talk about the other two.
3349,Let's get a coffee. <BR> Yes.  Great.  Kevin I'11 send Bean in to keep you company.
3350,Betty it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley? <BR> He was a President. <BR> President?  Past Presidents! Betty this is beginning to add up. <BR> Really.  What'll I pin this on? <BR> Faith Betty.  But make sure it's your own.
3351,Stop it! <BR> There's more. <BR> Just stop. <BR> Just giving the facts. <BR> I'm calling the police. <BR> What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high you know bachelor party that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
3352,What looks good? <BR> Hmmmm... Well the scampi sounds good... <BR> You like shrimp?  I like shrimp.
3353,You young'uns worry about weapons I'm thinkin' bout strategy. <BR> Oh? And what's that? <BR> Sit still look less like a meal. <BR> I think that's for bears and sharks chunky chew.
3354,You didn't happen to call the house last night did you Grady? <BR> I think I might have. <BR> And what do you think you might have said? <BR> I think I might've said I was in love with you.
3355,Janet are you okay? Are you there? <BR> He... he's here... <BR> Who's there?
3356,I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them. <BR> Little - couldn't be an automobile could it?  Well well! Ain't that nice!
3357,I should go. Your sister worries and when she worries she yells. <BR> How is she? <BR> Annette? She's good... tense. <BR> When can I see her? <BR> I'm working on it. <BR> Is it because of Anna? <BR> I don't know. She won't talk about it. <BR> You're the only one in the family who still talks to me. <BR>  <BR> How old is Anna? <BR> She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come... <BR> Only if it's no closer than a hundred feet.
3358,How's your leg? <BR> Mmmm -- hurts a little. <BR> And your stomach? <BR> Empty as a football. <BR> And you love life? <BR> Not too active. <BR> Anything else bothering you? <BR> Uh-huh.
3359,Sorry. <BR> It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
3360,Who's gonna outfit us? <BR> Outfit? What's he talking about?
3361,Can you set up? <BR> It has to be temporary something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows... <BR> Think fast Sarah.
3362,Just got some news on Bell. <BR> What? <BR> Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again. <BR> Oh shit.
3363,I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband didn't they?... didn't they? <BR> I don't know. I mean yes probably. <BR> Yes positively. That's where he was drowned... <BR> What are you saying? <BR> There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license. <BR> I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
3364,But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard. <BR> Twice. <BR> Is that what you were trained to do? <BR> No. <BR> Then what do you think he was trying to do. <BR> Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas.
3365,Emma in Wonderland. Welcome Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete. <BR> Decontamination -- ? <BR> And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive.  He tells me you're very beautiful.

I'm sick of seeing you in them. <BR> I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money. <BR> I love how responsible you are. My Dad should make you Chief Accountant or something. Let me buy you a jacket. There's a great place when we get to Rome Batistoni.
3367,So sorry. <BR> I mean I can go uptown too. I live uptown but... uh what the hell I mean it'd be nice having company you know I mean I hate driving alone. <BR> Yeah.
3368,Dylan it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What? <BR> You get any sleep last night? <BR> More or less.  Dylan time to get dressed.  I'm late.
3369,You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came. <BR> I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope. <BR> What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line and Raoul -- <BR> I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting. <BR> Raoul is everything to me. <BR> I know. <BR> Oh my friend.
3370,Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office? <BR> No -- only occasional jobs.  <BR> Tired? <BR> You pay me. <BR> You're a very unusual stenographer -- <BR> Moreover... <BR> Moreover... 
3371,I do. <BR> Right. Cool. So how about we take a bath together? <BR> Hah hah you're funny. A bath. Like a brother and sister. Oh man I'm so wasted.
3372,I've seen worse.  Much worse. <BR> Strong stomach huh?  I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all.
3373,More wine sister?  Surely you can drink more than that. <BR> I was suddenly thinking about going to bed. <BR> Oh stay...  Don't you want to join the chorus of praises for Narcissus' glory?  Just remember he is a married man.
3374,You're going out. <BR> Yeah. <BR> You're going sailing. <BR> Maybe. <BR> Take me. <BR> No. <BR> I want to go with you! <BR> Quiet!  Shhh! <BR> Michael.... <BR> Okay okay.  Close your door.
3375,You're not yet three months are you? <BR> Not yet. What do you know about it? <BR> I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father? <BR> Don't trouble yourself about it Homer--this ain't your business. <BR> But you don't look very happy. <BR> *Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby. <BR> Rose please listen. Whatever you want to do I can help you.

3377,Where's the power and radio setup? <BR> Operations building.  Far end of the street.
3378,There's a guard outside my door! I'm a prisoner Nigel!  Do you understand that? <BR> Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners. <BR> Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you? <BR> Because I am a new man Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem Susan is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained. <BR> Is that what Argon told you? <BR> No!  Well not those exact words. <BR> Nigel can't you see he's using you? <BR> Of course he is but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door. <BR> You're afraid of him. <BR> Who isn't?
3379,ON MOSS AS HE WALKS THE GROGGY SCHUMANN TOWARD THE GAS STATION. <BR> ...how ya feeling boy?
3380,That's just how my brain works I guess. <BR> Fascinating. Listen why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me. <BR> Actually... I just want to go home. <BR> Oh don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
3381,I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late. <BR> 'Bye.
3382,It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive. <BR> It might be best if we didn't talk. <BR> All I mean is... someone like you... <BR> How many times have you done this? I'm interested. <BR> What? <BR> Scams con games.  How many? <BR> I don't know.  A lot. <BR> Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
3383,C'mon I need to talk to you. Just the two of us. <BR> Okay then you're crazy.
3384,Yah Shep Proudfoot said - <BR> Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives man? <BR> Shep said 8:30. <BR> We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already. <BR> I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up I guess. <BR> Ya got the car? <BR> Yah you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera. <BR> Yeah okay. Well siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud. <BR> Yah how ya doin'. So uh we all set on this thing then? <BR> Sure Jerry we're all set. Why wouldn't we be? <BR> Yah no I'm sure you are. Shep vouched for you and all. I got every confidence in you fellas.
3385,Very well Herr Laszlo we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca. <BR> Whether or not you succeed is of course problematical. <BR> Not at all. Captain Renault's signature is necessary on every exit visa.  Captain would you think it is possible that Herr Laszlo will receive a visa?
3386,She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy. <BR> Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle? <BR> She loves me the way no woman ever has.
3387,It's not enough snow not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there kid. <BR> Don't worry Mr. Twombley I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten. <BR> Guaranteed eh? <BR> Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for ain't it? <BR> Damn straight!
3388,Our speciality. <BR> I can't wait to begin on him. Really Bert I don't know what we'd do without you!
3389,I didn't think they even enforced this. <BR> Living proof. <BR> I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids. <BR> I don't; you did. <BR> Really? <BR> Little girl. Maybe five years old? <BR> Holy shit. That girl? <BR> As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here. <BR> Then how come you got the fine? <BR> Because I'm here. <BR> You're lying. <BR> I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up. <BR> Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now? <BR> Because I'm happy. <BR> You're happy? <BR> I'm happy. <BR> You're happy to get a fine? <BR> No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me. <BR> Now I know you're lying. <BR> I'm not. She just left. <BR> What did she say? <BR> She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother. <BR> You're kidding. <BR> I'm not. <BR> Wow. You've had quite an evening. <BR> She went home she's getting ready and we're going out. <BR> I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you? <BR> Watch the store while I go home and change. <BR> What happened to title dictates behavior? <BR> This is my way of spitting water at life. <BR> Hey what about Veronica? <BR> No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime nobody mentions the V word. <BR> You're a snake. <BR> In my absence try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns. <BR> You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this? <BR> I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin in which case you'll have to close the store tonight. <BR> All right but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks. <BR> I'll read the book.
3390,I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here... <BR> I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon. <BR> How much do you know? <BR> What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions? <BR> Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that; <BR> What else did you keep out of the papers? <BR> Blond right-handed really strong wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive. <BR> Somebody hurt him? <BR> Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
3391,Oh. <BR> Hi. <BR> What do you want Stan? <BR> Can I... I brought some --
3392,Shhhhhhh! <BR> What?! <BR> It's ok.  Everything's under control.
3393,I'll give you a boost. <BR> You first. <BR> This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you how are you going to get there? <BR> You pull me up. <BR> It's much easier this way.  Come on step up... <BR> No. <BR> Please... <BR> I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There I said it.  Satisfied. <BR> Oh.  FIne.
3394,Check it out. Not for the faint of heart. <BR> Pharmaceutical! You are a god. <BR> One for you and one for me.
3395,I'll go. <BR> Wrong. <BR> What vou? <BR> I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
3396,SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR... <BR> Shut up. Stop. Stop it.
3397,Do you think you're ready? <BR> It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me I want you what else is there...but you me the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far. <BR> I'll let you know.
3398,Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around. <BR> Good idea.
3399,I ain't no more a preacher you know. <BR> We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words. <BR> 
3400,Good luck. I love that guy but why does he have to follow us around? <BR> Anyway what I was wanting to say was this --
3401,Take any one ya like. <BR> Kinda early for Christmas Bugs. <BR> A Jew's gotta let his heart tell him when ta give his presents.
3402,Are you sick Mama? <BR> No Estellita. <BR> Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession? <BR> Later. When I finish the ironing.
3403,In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives. <BR> It's your best play Nicky. <BR> He'll hate it. <BR> He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut where you watch things grow.
3404,Good morning Pimenov. <BR> Good morning Gru -- your --
3405,One shot stopping. <BR> 'One shot stopping'... good very good.  I like you Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here hold it.  Check out the weight.
3406,Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts. <BR> They would have killed this man? <BR> People get hysterical enough they do anything.  Look Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself I got to send you over to the Army. <BR> How long will that take? <BR> They can tell right away. They've got a couple of doctors who saw this man in the hospital.  Take him over to G2.
3407,Jack listen -- we'll cut a deal -- <BR> JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
3408,What happened between you and the blonde? <BR> What? <BR> The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard. <BR> It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes. <BR> Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman John? <BR> She's dead.
3409,What happened was I'm on vacation alone... I was robbed at gunpoint. They hit me and ran.  Two men a few blocks away.  They took my wallet money... all of it.  So... <BR> Robbed? <BR> Yes. <BR> Have you gone to the police? <BR> I don't speak Spanish.  All I need is to get back... just enough for that.
3410,You boys carryin' pieces? <BR> You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy. <BR> See if these two are my friends.
3411,Oh thank God. It's going. <BR> It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
3412,What are you doing?  You're going to kill us! <BR> No.  If anyone dies from a crash now it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list. <BR> Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive? <BR> What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn? <BR> Six duds in a row. <BR> And when it was Rory's turn to die and Thomas was in the way?
3413,Excuse me I need to explain... <BR> Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
3414,You're fuckin' crazy. <BR> But only on purpose Tommy. <BR> This is nice. I mean it.
3415,Keep going over these. I don't want anybody getting lost. <BR> If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso.
3416,Cynthia... that would not be a good idea. <BR> I'm just offering a place to stay. <BR> I understand Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me. <BR> Okay but you don't know what you're missing. <BR> Git along little dowgie and call me back.
3417,Even if I were inclined I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife. <BR> Three times to be exact. <BR> Excuse me? <BR> Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives so we've been informed. <BR> Can't imagine by who. I don't suppose the truth would interest you: that I've never had another wife but Evelyn.
3418,No.  The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code.  And your message has to go out in it or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him. <BR> Book code? <BR> 'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book? <BR> Not the Bible? <BR> No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible.
3419,Uh look... if you're serious about wanting a job picking apples isn't that boring. <BR> Oh I would love that Wally.
3420,Mr. Sisler was one of them. <BR> The principal? <BR> Yes. <BR> Who was the fourth?
3421,Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus. <BR> What do you mean sir?
3422,Hi.  Didn't get a chance to say goodbye. <BR> That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name. <BR> I didn't know what else to call you. <BR> Claire. <BR> Claire.  Pleased to meet you.
3423,I'd like an ice-cold Heineken. <BR> That sounds good. <BR> Two.
3424,Now why don't you go watch some TV or something? <BR> Are you okay Violet? <BR> Mickey why is Johnnie here?  You know how I feel about that fucking psycho.
3425,I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin' Homer but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today! <BR> Is it true?
3426,Jeffrey I don't think you ought to do it. <BR> Why not? <BR> It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you. <BR> It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car? <BR> Yeah. but. <BR> Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay? <BR> O.K. <BR> Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit. <BR> . I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee. <BR> I'm going in Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went. <BR> I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over. <BR> Oh okay. can I call? <BR> Okay. yeah call. <BR> Look. it can wait till Sunday. <BR> Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep? <BR> Yeah. <BR> I'm going to wait here until she comes. <BR> Are you sure? <BR> I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
3427,Smashing!  Welcome to the family Ted. You are going to breathe some new life into this place. You are going to set the world on fire! You are going to...call me Uncle Billy? Please? <BR> Uh sure. Uncle Billy. <BR> I have only one concern...
3428,She was old. <BR> Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites. <BR> Maybe an animal. <BR> An animal?  What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex or what?
3429,Yo-yo-yiggity-yo. <BR> I am a suicide risk. <BR> Is this Juno? <BR> No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting? <BR> Only the one in my pants. <BR> Dude I'm pregnant. <BR> Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch? <BR> It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout. <BR> How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests? <BR> I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier. <BR> Is this for real? Like for real for real? <BR> Unfortunately yes. <BR> Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand! <BR> That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take. <BR> Well are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke. <BR> I know. Women Now I guess. The commercial says they help women now. <BR> Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year. <BR> Eh I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
3430,What does that mean? <BR> It's a problem in celestial mechanics. <BR> Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer. <BR> He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
3431,I'm a bitch. <BR> Yes you are. <BR> And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you. <BR> Yes he is.
3432,What's the matter Mr. Kringelein? <BR> General Director Preysing!  Baron when I was sixteen years old I started as an office boy in that man's factory -- <BR> Then you know him? <BR> Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
3433,I heard about your sister and I... understand your pain... <BR> Why did she have to die? <BR> Only God knows the answer to that. <BR> I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever! <BR> I realize your anger Jeanne but we must learn to forgive.  It's hard but revenge will never bring about peace. <BR> Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!! <BR> Jeanne... calm down...!  Calm down Jeanne!
3434,Maybe you're having twins. Maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice! <BR> Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go pronto.
3435,What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here! <BR> Hey Sammy tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker. <BR> Nicky Nicky you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both. <BR> Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money Sammy. <BR> I'm gonna okay you ten and get you even and that's it. Then you got to get out of here before the cops and the newspapers are all over you.
3436,When will he be back? <BR> Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh he went home. <BR> Does he always leave so early? <BR> Oh he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time. <BR> You used to be a much better liar Sam. <BR> Leave him alone Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him. <BR> Play it once Sam for old time's sake. <BR> I don't know what you mean Miss Ilsa. <BR>  <BR> Oh I can't remember it Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
3437,I don't ever want to see you. <BR> Then why'd you come after me?
3438,Say listen you wouldn't know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the pants.  Yeah?  Sure sure I got your copy. Why didn't you tell me you were going to write it in Greek? I'd start a new department. <BR> That was free verse you gashouse palooka! <BR> Free verse huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well I'm here to tell you it's not gonna cost us any more. <BR> That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story for you or anybody else if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that <BR> When you get through with that I'll have a beard down to my ankles. 
3439,Well I realized if you're getting married you're gonna be needing the maid of honor right? <BR> Actually no.  There's not going to be a wedding. <BR> Oh.
3440,Finally some gratitude. <BR> We're grateful Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
3441,Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito? <BR> No. <BR> You're sure? <BR> 
3442,Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying? <BR> Yes. <BR> Good. Or should I speak slower? <BR> Yes. <BR> Do you follow or should I speak slower? <BR> Yes.
3443,Well for the last week anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball but he's really stuck on me which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's like a dope but he says these smart and moving things sometimes out of nowhere that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph. <BR> Oh yeah. <BR> That made me cry. But anyway we went up to Boston because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year. <BR> That's scary sounding. <BR> Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like it just isn't right with him. Y'know? <BR> I think so. <BR> I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel you should come up to the Charles with me sometime. <BR> Okay. <BR> Yeah? Oh great!
3444,And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime -- <BR> Nothing completely conclusive --
3445,Damn. <BR> You alright? <BR> I think I ruined the sauce...again.
3446,How's California? <BR> How should I know? <BR> But Mose Harper said... <BR> That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
3447,I loved you much as King and sometimes as husband but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky. <BR> Forgive me my wife if you can. I was not born to live a man's life but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was and the dream of what could be. <BR> I have kept it.
3448,Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon-- <BR> Come on in.
3449,Any problems? <BR> No just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it Dennis.
3450,...Now I know you've had some problems struggling with the narcotics some other entanglements currently on parole - <BR> So? <BR> Well associating with criminals if you're the one they talked to that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater. <BR> Uh-huh. <BR> Now I saw some rough stuff on your priors but nothing in the nature of a homicide...
3451,The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born. <BR> I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling remember Athos? <BR> But I was on duty...
3452,Buffy the ape-woman. <BR> Seriously Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
3453,The MCP blasted it... There are very few domains left with any power at all. <BR> Lousy utility companies ... they're the same wherever you go.
3454,Do you like talk like that? <BR> No. <BR> Lie down on the bed.
3455,Mother of God! <BR> It is also a place of burial. <BR> A tomb?  We're in a tomb? <BR> Catacombs.  Very holy.
3456,Positive. <BR> Did you do everything I asked you to? <BR> Yes. <BR> You told her I never said I love you before? <BR> Yes! <BR> You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded? <BR> Yes! <BR> And you think she bought it? <BR> I'm pretty sure she did. <BR> Pretty sure or sure sure? <BR> She bought it. <BR> I'll be in touch.
3457,Hello I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing Post and...  Mullen and Company Public Relations? Could you tell me when you expect Mr. Hunt?  He is? <BR> Howard Hunt here. <BR> Hi I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and-- <BR> --yes yes what is it? <BR> I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate? <BR> Good God!
3458,I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog. <BR> You? <BR> Trust me James when the family pet's been assassinated the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman. <BR> Does she want to hear it was one of her professors? <BR> I've got tenure.
3459,So <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'? <BR> Okay. <BR> I'm Bernard by the way.  Those are cool Reeboks Neil.  They're real new aren't they?
3460,Feeling all right? <BR> Yeah.  That guy who beat me?  I feel stoned.
3461,No definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further. <BR> It's the only way. <BR> I refuse. <BR> You're frightened. <BR> No I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference I mean alive dead dead alive that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up.
3462,Barefaced. <BR> He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother right?
3463,Sull!  What the hell! <BR> I talked to him Gordo.  I talked to my Dad.
3464,For very long? <BR> I don't see anyone for very long Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this then or now. Is this all?
3465,I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning. <BR> I'm sorry this can't wait.
3466,...Well it didn't make him happy... <BR> But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life? <BR> No. <BR> Mrs. Mulwray do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
3467,I tell you - this is the only way to travel. <BR> You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing. <BR> No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party. <BR> I may spill something. <BR> So spill it.  Spills thrills laughs games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party. <BR> What's the surprise? <BR> Uh-uh.  Not yet. <BR> When? <BR> We better have a drink first. <BR> Here.  This'll put hair on your chest. <BR> No fair guessing.
3468,She's not a little girl any more. <BR> You've seen her!...She's alive? <BR> I've seen her...and she's alive.
3469,I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it? <BR> I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real and so is where we are. <BR> Then why isn't there anyone around? <BR> [Beat] I don't know.
3470,Where am I? <BR> The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ... <BR> Was I? <BR> I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ... <BR> It was Peter -- I saw him ...
3471,414 - that's the same room number I had in Cincinnati - my last time around with a male band. What a heel he was. <BR> Saxophone player? <BR> What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face. <BR> Forget it Sugar will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one. <BR> What makes you so sure? <BR> Just my feminine intuition.
3472,It's only temporary. On a freelance basis. <BR> And this one in case you haven't guessed is Junior. <BR> Hi there little brother. <BR> Say hi to Paul.
3473,Does it hurt? <BR> I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
3474,"I left my husband two days ago. <BR> Really? <BR> I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop... <BR> Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas... <BR> Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good... <BR> Nice move. Cedars Sinai? <BR> No. Loma Vista. <BR> I s'pose his name's David Ravell. <BR> How did you know? <BR> What's his real name? <BR> Dr. David Ravell. <BR> You mean... George McCord, the actor? <BR> No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon."
3475,They were all over the place. <BR> You smell like ass!
3476,Daphne... <BR> Yes Osgood? <BR> You're leading again. <BR> Sorry.
3477,Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog? <BR> It's Walter's dog and yes she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on your shoes are in the hail.
3478,I got this apartment with a guy. <BR> The one you were telling me about? <BR> No this one was worse... I had to have the place sprayed when he left. Twice... He was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there which I'm trusting you with 'cause if it gets out I'm on the street...
3479,Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced? <BR> Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much. <BR> So what happened? <BR> I never got lost. For some reason I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone and no one in particular. See once you get into the habit of not needing anyone it's kind of hard to break. <BR> You must get lonely at times. <BR> Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want if I want. <BR> Woman friends too? <BR> I'm a loner I'm not a monk.
3480,-- car keys? <BR> -- my coat -- but we should -- <BR> -- what? -- <BR> -- take the back -- get another car --
3481,"That depends. <BR> I mean really deeply angry... <BR> I don't think I could be. <BR> Well. I don't want to play Cora."""""""
3482,How is she? <BR> A little slow but she'll be fine. <BR> Have you talked to Triplette? <BR> Who the hell is he? <BR> He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker. <BR> Who the hell is he? <BR> He's going to run for president. <BR> Third party? <BR> He has that sign with the tree. <BR> What does he want? <BR> Barbara Jean. <BR> What! <BR> That's what he wants. <BR> You know better than that. <BR> It's on National television Barnett. <BR> I don't care. She's always been neutral in politics and that's not going to change.
3483,On me yes. On Blade I'm not so sure --  The problem is Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is I could probably cure every vampire but him. <BR> Then we're back to square one aren't we? Sooner or later the Thirst always wins.
3484,We had a report of gunfire so if you could -- <BR> Gunfire?  Is this a joke?
3485,It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he -- <BR> Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
3486,Y'call that art? Why my three-year-old can paint better than that. <BR> Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin you little...<u>doodle</u>.
3487,Punishment you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments. <BR> Who killed Raspail Doctor...? You know don't you? <BR> I've been in this room for eight years Clarice. I know they will never ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree or even water. I want to be in a federal institution away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me but he won't. You persuade him. <BR> Who killed your patient? <BR> Oh a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet. <BR> Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him all those years ago...? That's impossible.
3488,What's funny? <BR> No nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi.  And now look at you.
3489,Yep.  He watched the whole thing happen - - Recognize the beat cop?  Jim Gordon <BR> Oh Bruce... <BR> Something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to?
3490,Don't write that part. <BR> Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release? <BR> Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me. <BR> Life must be peachy on Planet Ted. <BR>  <BR> I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer. <BR> My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did. <BR> Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
3491,Oh God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough? <BR> Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself. <BR> You're right. Phew!
3492,Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual. <BR> I know everybody says it but I really mean it.
3493,...thirteen fifty six... <BR> Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.
3494,Will the elements be gone now forever from this place? <BR> When mankind comes to its senses. We will return. <BR> Knowing mankind as I do that could take centuries! <BR> Time is of no importance only life is important.
3495,Yes. <BR> When? <BR> Tomorrow. <BR> Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted will you pardon him? <BR> No.
3496,"What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed! <BR> No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her. <BR> You're lying! <BR> I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen... <BR> That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect! <BR> I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this."
3497,--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them I know it -- <BR> Whoa whoa easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?
3498,Assuming we can trust Joe how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here but he ain't which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops dead robbers dead civilians... Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible. <BR> Before you got here Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops but if we don't he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here. <BR> Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now I don't know a goddamn body who can help him so if you know somebody call 'em. <BR> I don't know anybody. <BR> Well I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us I say it's his decision. <BR> Well he knows a little about me. <BR> You didn't tell him your name did ya? <BR> I told him my first name and where I'm from.
3499,Okay. thanks. <BR> I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert. <BR> That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay? <BR> Okay okay. Bye.
3500,Tell me you'll call. <BR> Okay. <BR> Will you? <BR> I said I would... <BR> But will you? <BR> Are you still on mediction? <BR> Why would you say that?
3501,It's like being a producer Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there and strut and <u>Posture</u>.  But somebody knows what's what got to jump in and Save the Thing.  <BR> Why Albania? <BR> Why not?
3502,Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours. <BR> Now that's a crap company sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it. <BR> Old values. Buy.
3503,I'll wait. <BR> It's not like anyone could actually open it.
3504,What are we doing? <BR> Why don't we see a movie? <BR> Well where?
3505,won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor. I wish there was something I could do for you <BR> Well you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide.  There is something you can do for me Miss Schuyler.
3506,This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where Starling he took vocational rehab and learned a useful trade... <BR> Sewing... <BR>  <BR> Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in - <BR> No Starling there isn't time. And you've still got crucial work to do in Ohio. We want him for murder not kidnapping. I'm counting on you to link him to the Bimmel girl before he's indicted.
3507,Yah I got the money but uh - <BR> Don't you fucking but me Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp top level thirty minutes and we'll wrap this up. <BR> Yah okay but uh - <BR> You're there in thirty minutes or I find you Jerry and I shoot you and I shoot your fucking wife and I shoot all your little fucking children and I shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. Got it? <BR> ...Yah well you stay away from Scotty now - <BR> GOT IT? <BR> Okay real good then.
3508,Hello again I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks. <BR> Excuse me. <BR> Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink. <BR> Oh yes I remember you. <BR> Destiny took us apart but I knew it would bring us back together. <BR> Aha. Poet or philosopher? <BR> Stock broker. As in: never have so few done so little for so much. So what do you see in this?
3509,You doing okay? <BR> Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now. <BR> Oh man that kid takes himself real serious. <BR> Yeah you still with Northland? <BR> Foreman now. <BR> No shit. <BR> Five years. <BR> Beautiful. How's business? <BR> Booming. Lots of building going on. We can't keep up with all the work. In fact I just hired a few new guys...
3510,Miss Ida Sessions again. She says you know her. <BR> Okay.
3511,Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff isn't he? <BR> Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
3512,Let me try this goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK SHE CAN DO IT NOW! <BR> I SAID FORGET IT!
3513,Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. Trouble is they're little they ain't got much say-so. <BR> Shore looks like my lucky day anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.
3514,I'm not usually drunk. <BR> Not usually this drunk.
3515,I'm fucking out of here. <BR> Lawford? <BR> Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.
3516,Quiet. You'll wake the men and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives. <BR> I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones... <BR> What is this place Merlin? <BR> It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events.  But the earth is being torn apart its metals stolen and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact I nearly didn't make it in one piece.
3517,What is it? <BR> A meat locker. <BR> We can't just leave them here.
3518,And did you? <BR> I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school. <BR> Why did you stop? <BR> My children. And Richard didn't like my working. <BR> Do you miss it? <BR> I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it. <BR> You're asking a man if he's too tired to talk about himself? You don't get out much do you?
3519,What did he say? <BR> He said he doesn't know. <BR> He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux. What did he say?
3520,You said he washed the money? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Then what?  Exactly. <BR> He hung it up. <BR> What? <BR> To let it dry.
3521,Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what? <BR> I don't know what I'm supposed say Mary. I want to do the right thing here. <BR>  <BR> I have a family Mary. <BR> You made me have an abortion. <BR> It was a mutual decision. <BR> You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you -- <BR> I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But look I take full responsibility.
3522,What did you do today Satan? <BR> You don't care. <BR> Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love. <BR> Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK. <BR> That's because I wanted to fuck you dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down! <BR> Don't call me dumb! <BR> I mean cute dumb. Now bend over!
3523,Are you ready to order here? <BR> Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same. <BR> Anything to drink? <BR> Two Cokes. <BR> Okay. Thanks.
3524,Do you hear buzzing Fish? <BR> Buzzing? <BR> Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull. <BR> I don't hear it. <BR> Yeah well it's a nasty problem. <BR> Have another drink.
3525,Martin it's not funny! <BR> You know it's not always easy for me either.  But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.
3526,I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting? <BR> Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
3527,What? <BR> They turn out marvelous material in Manchester. <BR> Manchester -- yes. Yes yes they do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning? -- Have we cigars -- water and everything?
3528,Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station? <BR> Yes. <BR> Well you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober. <BR> I don't think I will Rick. <BR> Why not? After all I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know. <BR> Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca not last night. <BR> Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like hiding from the police running away all the time? <BR> You can believe that if you want to. <BR> Well I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now above a saloon it's true but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.
3529,Twenty-three to be exact. <BR> I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  You can afford to spend some money.  If I was you I'd spare myself all the hard work.  Besides didn't you want to start writing again?
3530,Hey Mr Rothstein it'll make it a lot easier on everybody here if we just let her in the house. <BR> If we let her get a few of her things we'll be out of your hair.
3531,He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson Audio Consultant.' <BR> Should we buy a frame for that? <BR> Come on Linda I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week? <BR> Listen Stace you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well guess what? They don't call. <BR> So what did you do? <BR> I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him. <BR> I can't do that.
3532,I need to know who you are first please. <BR> Oh.  We are Russian. <BR> Yes. I know. <BR> Good.  <BR> And... <BR> And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
3533,Ow you're hurting me! <BR> Listen guy you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
3534,I'd like to talk to you I really would but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial. <BR> You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--
3535,Lord forgive me.. they already know too much.. <BR>  <BR> Amen..
3536,Duffy go over and sit on Mulvihill.  Jesus Christ I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you. <BR> Jake it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better. <BR> Gimme your keys. Watch this old fart will you?  Take Duffy's car. Curly's boat's in Pedro near the Starkist cannery. It's the Evening Star. He'll be waiting. I'll take care of this.
3537,They way you drive I can see why. <BR> I...I shot a kid.
3538,Did you say you were thinking about adoption? <BR> Yeah well there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
3539,Yeah watch the road! <BR> You'll total the whole car.
3540,I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works. <BR> Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.
3541,...same pain in the ass god bless her talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast near Tampa like to get out for good but can't afford it. <BR> ...Work okay? <BR> ...this drug testing is driving my guys nuts. I got flagged for my blood pressure pills. The only good news is we just met with the comptroller over some union stuff...'member that crash last summer? and the investigation? Well the FAA is gonna rule it was a manufacturing flaw in the door latch mechanism. I kept telling 'em it wasn't maintenance it was those goddamn greedy manufacturers out in Cincinnati. And I was right.
3542,She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live! <BR> I'll help her I promise but I think you should tell me where the Stones are! <BR> Do you love her? <BR> I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time! <BR> I don't have time... I need to know. <BR> Listen the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again. <BR> I would like to have died in peace...
3543,You mean like...  Oh my darlin' oh my darlin' oh my darlin' Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing? <BR> Yeah like that. <BR> Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic.
3544,I've got some pictures.  Want to see? <BR> No thanks. <BR> Ah come on. <BR> I don't want to see any goddamn pictures.
3545,Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought. <BR> You're wrong -- a few minutes more and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then. <BR> You don't have a few minutes Frost.
3546,Damn Porkchop you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair. <BR> I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.
3547,No. I haven't seen them. <BR> Do you think you have a good memory for faces? <BR> Same as everyone else. <BR> But in your work you must meet lots of different people every day -- new people new faces. No? <BR> Yes. <BR> And what do you recognize names or faces? <BR> Diseases. <BR> Like recognizing criminals by their crimes. <BR> I suppose so. <BR> I mean that's what it's like. <BR> Sorry? <BR> And you said you supposed so but I wasn't offering it for debate.
3548,You heard?  They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together.  Listen I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit. <BR> It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure. <BR> Forget it the main thing--  --did you call me a failure? <BR> I was sure trying.
3549,This is Wednesday. <BR> Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory? <BR> Wrong day? <BR> Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon. <BR> That's too bad Jeff. Well I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called. <BR> Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you Gunnison. Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week.
3550,"All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real. <BR> If we're for real? <BR> You don't exactly look like drug dealers."
3551,Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck or somepin. He can't stay here. <BR> Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  Reckon we could git him *drunk*? <BR> Ain't no whisky is they?
3552,How is bank? <BR> Fine. I thought you were leaving today. <BR> To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
3553,No I don't want one.  Hey Mr Clark how you doin'? <BR> Hi. Good. <BR> I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President. <BR> Well I've been busy.  <BR> Yeah least you could do is return my phone calls though. <BR> Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and uh I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss. <BR> Yeah.  I think I want my money back. <BR> What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me? <BR> You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you and uh... if you don't have my money for me I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail hopefully you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do don't we Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it. <BR> You can't talk to me like... <BR> Hey you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep. <BR> Sam? <BR> Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is personal.  I'll be there in the morning. You can fuckin' try me fatso.
3554,You know I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne maybe get her on the rebound eh? <BR> When it comes to women you're a true democrat.
3555,Why should I? We're happy aren't we darling? <BR> Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas and they concern you Anne. <BR> None of your ideas can be goofy Stew if they concern me. <BR> My name is Smith - well that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots I hate peas I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet. <BR> That's because you're too far away Stew.
3556,Yeah? <BR> Mr. Campbell? <BR> Huh? <BR> Is this Neighborly Life Insurance? <BR> Oh umm yes this is Dwight Campbell. <BR> It's Sue Ann Rogers Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
3557,So you two were just uh telling old campfire stories were you? <BR> Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want but I was there. <BR> You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw.  You violated that agreement. <BR> You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children. <BR> If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy I hardly see how I am to-- <BR> I didn't tell anything I told the truth. <BR> You version of it. <BR> There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver it's my life. <BR> We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries. <BR> It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never-- <BR> InGen is my livelihood Dr. Malcolm and I will jealously defend its interests.  People will know what I want them to know when I want them to know it.
3558,"Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em? <BR> They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit."
3559,High time you got back. <BR> I met some very interesting women at the showers. We got to chatting about this and that. You know how time files.
3560,How long is this going to take? <BR> We have a few more minutes. <BR> I mean when will I be normal. <BR> We have a lot of work to do. <BR> Will I ever be normal? <BR> I couldn't say. <BR> You couldn't say. <BR> I'm afraid not. <BR>  <BR> I suppose it's however society defines it. <BR> How do you define it? <BR> I don't. <BR> Then how do you know if your patients are getting better? <BR> They usually tell me. <BR> How do they know? <BR> What is your idea of being normal? <BR> What is your idea of being a Jew? <BR> Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you.  Why don't we continue this on Thursday. <BR> I want to be normal! <BR> Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal! <BR> Fuck you Rosen! <BR> I know -- <BR> You don't know! <BR> I know you're frustrated Walter but --
3561,Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there! <BR> Now. Your sister is missing how long? <BR> She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until... <BR> How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
3562,I don't know. <BR> If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you think again.
3563,Yes!  God yes!  I would tell her that I love her!  To not let anyone take away her dreams..! <BR>  <BR> Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished either. But let's find out... <BR> How do you mean?                                            ]
3564,I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president. <BR> He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick. <BR> My point exactly!  Somebody had to die before his shit got in the paper! Fucking Kennedys get away with everything.  Do you see me screwing everything that moves?  For Christ's sake!  I did what the New York Times editorial page said we should do!  I ended the war I got SALT I with the Russians I opened China!  So why are these cocksuckers turning on me?  Because they don't like the way I look.  Where I went to school.
3565,First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men. <BR> I see. The men. You'll strike maybe for your demands -- but what the wives want that comes later always later. <BR> Now don't start talking against the union again. <BR> What has it got me your union?
3566,Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again. <BR> Well done.
3567,You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive. <BR> No I'm gonna drive. <BR> No I'm not gonna drive with some crazy - <BR> You're driving me nuts!
3568,Gentlemen I tried.  I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.  He heard me and he made his decision.  I appreciate your sentiments.  I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots but it's nothing I can do anything about.  Now it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ... <BR> Dick these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60. <BR> Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson. <BR> That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of. <BR> Nobody's gonna beat Kennedy in '64 with all the money in the world.
3569,Do you know Barbara Jean? <BR> Sure do. Good friend of Haven's. <BR> Haven's not going to talk to me. <BR> Sure he will.
3570,I'm in the bath mom. <BR> Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch. <BR> Okay.
3571,Where did you get that? <BR> At the newsstand on 3rd.
3572,No. <BR> Cool. Well let's sit down and get to know each other a bit.
3573,Oh. <BR> Giovanni this is Faith's friend Peter. <BR> Oh hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink but-- <BR> I'd love to.
3574,Hey you guys are wearin' white. It must be in the stars. <BR> Yeah. Right. <BR> Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace. <BR> We're gonna operate together.
3575,You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you! <BR> Because he's out of shape.
3576,Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for? <BR> It was a gift... from my brother. <BR> How thoughtful.  The gift of inconvenience.
3577,How is he? <BR> Resting he's had a long day. Aramis -- <BR> More wine!! <BR> You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child he -- <BR> You can do it. <BR> In a year maybe two I could teach him enough to -- <BR> Three days. <BR> Three days??!! <BR> The King is having a ball a masquerade ball.  It is the perfect opportunity and perhaps our only one.  At any time Phillippe could be discovered and what then?  Remember France.  Remember the poor. Remember Raoul.  More wine!!  Where are those serving girls...?
3578,What's there to do at the Point? God Lisa we've been going together almost two years and... <BR> Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool. <BR> Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years! <BR> I don't want to talk about it here Brad.
3579,Okay James I wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico that's no reason for him to take two in the chest. Still the fact remains that I'm the one who took you up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one who has to take the blame. I don't know what the hell I was thinking. <BR> Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act. <BR> Thanks for the halo James but I've never done that much thinking ahead in my life -- ever.
3580,What else? <BR> Packs an emotional wallop. <BR> What else? <BR> A flat-out hit.
3581,Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?! <BR> Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying. <BR> No way. <BR> Can we just talk this out? <BR> Talk what out? We are locked and loaded here. We are non-refundable. I've got relatives on the airport right now! I've got...
3582,Sure. Anyplace in particular? <BR> I hear the China Club is a laugh.
3583,I could have ended it tonight but I didn't. <BR> Why? <BR> I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power-- <BR> You also have a power Conner.  It is why you have survived.
3584,I'll do that. <BR> It's really important. <BR> I understand. Good night.
3585,What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here Homer. <BR> Mrs. Worthington I feel I'm very lucky to be here. <BR> There's not a lot of work in the winter and you'll have to tolerate Vernon--even Wally despises him and Wally likes everyone.
3586,Shut up. Mickey you and I can take her late evening. <BR> Sig Ep's gotta band tonight. <BR> Too bad.
3587,Saddam would you let me do my job please! <BR> Hey relax guy. Let's see what the kid wants.
3588,But it IS! Look! <BR> The important thing is not to panic.
3589,Man Telly your little brother is getting big. <BR> Yeah.
3590,Don't give it to me. Don't! <BR> Oooh! Here! Here! <BR> Look! Look one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus! <BR> Get him! <BR> Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey look... put it in the pot. <BR> I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water. <BR> Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What- what's he think we're gonna do take him to the movies?
3591,Yeah. <BR> History man history. How much? <BR> Two kilos. <BR> Where? <BR> The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States. <BR> Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty. <BR> Twenty months? <BR> Twenty fucking YEARS man - YEARS! I figger ten at the least.
3592,--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?-- <BR> --let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
3593,Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors? <BR> The usual motivation doesn't apply to him nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me my friend: leave this. <BR> And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over. <BR> How are Molly and the boy? <BR> Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana.  Who the hell is he to do this to my family Sidney? Answer me that...!
3594,Can't do what? <BR> We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
3595,Wait. <BR> Yes? <BR> Aren't you going to tell me who you are? <BR> Oh Faith.  My name's Faith. <BR> It's a pleasure to meet you Faith.
3596,"Talk about him Starling. Tell me what you see. <BR> He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house somewhere. Not an apartment. <BR> Why? <BR> What he does with them - takes privacy... Time tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious precise never impulsive... This won't end in suicide like they often do. <BR> Why not? <BR> He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work. <BR> Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out. <BR> Like I have a knack"""" for Dr. Lecter?"""
3597,But... <BR> But what? <BR> But I -- well maybe I love her. Elena.
3598,There's a rifle and a shotgun here. <BR> That's fine.
3599,'Less the place really is haunted. <BR> Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
3600,You might get hurt.  Listen if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day! <BR> I've had them since the day they were born.
3601,You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman. <BR> We can do this. We can get her out of here. <BR> Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow without anybody seeing so what you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone? <BR> Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
3602,Sorry I'm late... <BR> What makes you think we're here to meet you? <BR> Who else would you be?
3603,I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful. <BR> You be careful to. I'm going to miss you. <BR> Shall we go away for a couple of days? <BR> Yeah... I'd like that.
3604,Well I've seen her pictures and I don't think she's so hot. <BR> Oh you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why Gallagher she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens!  And oh has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens! <BR> Of course I haven't got a nose.
3605,Ma...  Ma I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it with Connie not here--an' me this way. <BR> Why honey it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy. <BR> I can't he'p it Ma. It don't make *me* giggly an' happy.
3606,Am I supposed to know him? <BR> Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours. <BR> Clients come and go. <BR> This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him. <BR> Huh I doubt it...  Friedman only deals directly with select customers. I handle the rabble...
3607,What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz? <BR> Yeah. Where is he?
3608,Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym. <BR> Excuse me? <BR> I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds. <BR> I didn't strain. I sighed. <BR> I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape. <BR> I don't think so. <BR> Oh I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized. <BR> They are not. <BR> Yes they are. You're out of shape. <BR> What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body. <BR> No fat but no tone either. You don't get enough exercise.
3609,Once we have control again we - - <BR> Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan Lex and Tim.  And John they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying you know?
3610,Get out of here -- <BR> I'm not leaving without you. <BR> You don't understand. The Thirst --
3611,And you're here <u>why</u>...? <BR> I'm here Mr. Moss because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party. <BR> Party's gonna need more than a couple bucks now.
3612,You like shoes? <BR> No I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight. <BR> It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it last time he was here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it.
3613,You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes has himself a vision. <BR> Sorry. <BR> I'm a full-blood Oglala. <BR> We've driven a long way. Where is this place? <BR> Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know just one of them what do ya call 'em fitful dreams? <BR> Yeah. Fitful dreams.
3614,Stop him yourself. <BR> You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning.  In time you perverted the truth.  You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.  How little you understand.
3615,It didn't hurt too much did it? <BR> Ye... <BR> --I'm pretty good at stitchery. I've sewn my father's wounds more than once.
3616,Woman can change better'n a man. Man lives in jerks--baby born or somebody dies that's a jerk--gets a farm or loses one an' that's a jerk. With a woman it's all one flow like a stream little eddies little waterfalls but the river it goes right on. Woman looks at it like that. <BR> Look at that ol' coffeepot steam!
3617,Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner. <BR> Two men... two guns in the Caddy. <BR> The boys found this on the floor in back of the Caddy.
3618,He's not here. <BR> I'm sorry about Zeus Millie. <BR> This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first. <BR> I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car. <BR> Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself. <BR> He's my father Millie. <BR> He's no father to you.
3619,Look if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car you can damn well stay in sight.  Okay? <BR> Okay Dad.
3620,I don't need a plant. <BR> Everyone needs a plant. This ivy is one tough baby. It's a cutting from one of mine.
3621,Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this... <BR> Tell me about it.
3622,They're migrants. <BR> Migrants? <BR> Yes. They pick fruit all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons.  The trick to Mr. Rose is you have to let him be the boss.
3623,I had no idea it's gotten that bad sis. <BR> Oh don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay. <BR> Then why do you? <BR> And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?
3624,Kyle? <BR> I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this...
3625,They said I'd never see FBI again and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I don't feed ya information on the Warriors it's back to the pen. I don't do this back to the pen. Your word against my word. Against a con Indian's word. I really got a chance man right? <BR> They sent me here Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth. <BR> What the fuck man? What do you people want? I did what you wasi'cu's told me to do. <BR> Leo Fast Elk... is alive.
3626,Hey you on television? <BR> No. Yeah once in a while. You know like occasionally. <BR> What's your name? <BR> You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference? <BR> You were on... uh the... uh the Johnny Carson right? <BR> Once in a while you know. I mean you know every now- <BR> What's your name?
3627,Now.  Where is d'Artagnan? <BR> Out directing the search for the traitors. <BR> When he returns watch him.  When he leaves again you tell me.
3628,Yes? <BR> Drinks are free right? <BR> Yes.  Would you care for another one? <BR> Yes.
3629,Were there any calls? <BR> Teddy called.  Me... And my mother called to see if Teddy called. Oh and your sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying and she'll be gone the whole weekend and...
3630,Where are we going? <BR> That tall bright building.  Near there.
3631,Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs? <BR> I appreciate it but I don't accept it. <BR> I'll raise it to two hundred thousand. <BR> My friend you could make it a million francs or three my answer would still be the same. <BR> There must be some reason why you won't let me have them. <BR> There is. I suggest that you ask your wife. <BR> I beg your pardon? <BR> I said ask your wife. <BR> My wife?
3632,It's regular. Okay? <BR> I could stand something regular.
3633,Today for the first time I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you and because he knew I loved you he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see couldn't you see? I don't know maybe it's grotesque to say this now so just write it on a piece of paper or something and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me. <BR> Why do you have Dickie's rings?
3634,Special Agent Scully -- <BR> I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me -- <BR> Evidence of what?
3635,Easy Boyd. <BR> No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?
3636,HUMMMM..... <BR> What happened? <BR> See if you can get a reading on tactal retention.  Try to estimate it without a meter reading.
3637,Tina! <BR> N-o-o-o-o-o-o.... <BR> It's okay it's okay.  What's the matter?  Tina?  Honey?  Hey --- <BR> No!  It's still there! <BR> What is it?  What's there? <BR> It's still there! <BR> I need a hand here....
3638,Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is  You needn't concern yourself about me young man. I can take care of myself. <BR> You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket. <BR> My ticket? <BR> I found it on the seat. <BR> Oh thank you. Must have fallen out of my pocket.
3639,Icarus? <BR> I promise my dear I will give the matter some consideration. <BR> Consideration? <BR> If you honestly trust me then you'll have to trust me.
3640,Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard. <BR>  <BR> He's the reason the place turned into a shooting gallery.  What are you a silent partner? Fuckin' tell him.
3641,You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here. <BR> We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call. <BR> Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours. <BR> I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max. <BR> Oh I'll represent alright.
3642,Do those two work for your dad or mine? <BR> Mine and they never tip.
3643,Oh he's adorable Annie. <BR> You think so? Do you really? <BR> We're going to take them to the airport.
3644,Where are you going? <BR> I'm on my way to Venice.  Why? <BR> Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats right?... <BR> Huh?  Uh yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi.  Maybe someday we can all get together.
3645,Hey hey I'm just the Producer I'm just the <u>Stationmaster</u> Johnny Green wrote that song and... <BR> All we have to do now is sell it to the President.
3646,...mmm? <BR> It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u> and of your <u>President</u>... <BR> Izzat the thing... <BR> Indeed it is.
3647,She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while what do you talk about? I mean for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are... <BR> I did.
3648,It's an important issue. <BR> Alvy you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
3649,...So? <BR> Three-cent stamp. <BR> Your mallard? <BR> Yah. <BR> Norm that's terrific!
3650,I got him on the knee! <BR> You missed him! <BR> God damn It Jack he still ain't touched the plate.
3651,You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late. <BR> Baby? And what baby is that? <BR> Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you. <BR> Yeah well there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now. <BR> What are you talking about? <BR> An abortion stupid.  I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  Bye-bye baby!
3652,Yah okay. How's the hotel? <BR> Oh pretty good. They bitin'? <BR> Yeah couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel? <BR> Oh fine. <BR> Not on your feet too much? <BR> No no. <BR> You shouldn't be on your feet too much you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there? <BR> Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good. <BR> Was it reasonable? <BR> Yah not too bad. So it's nice up there? <BR> Yah it's good. No pike yet but it's good.
3653,If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor or anything else -- then stand now and let it happen. <BR> I cannot Athos.  Dearly as I love you I cannot.
3654,Pollution? <BR> Do you know what I see?  I see man making his own clouds.  I see man coloring his own sky and like this garden it is a site that makes my heart sing.
3655, <BR> Hello <u>King</u>.  How the heck <u>are</u> you...?  <u>Get</u> out...  <u>Get</u> out... Well man you fall in love like a <u>Hillbilly</u>...  Ditch the wife toss the kids in the Pick-up   Listen King:  <u>Get</u> your fat redneck ass out here <u>willya</u>... <BR> ...but the President wonders about the Possible Albanian Backlash...
3656,It's done. A truce. We meet at the river. <BR> Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
3657,What did you see? <BR> I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
3658,The war. <BR> That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him? <BR> Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes. <BR> The war dropped him here and forgot him. <BR> Yes I was in the war.
3659,...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it. <BR> Then how are you supposed to get back? <BR> Can't.  Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me.
3660,Do you want Athos arrested your Majesty? <BR> Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
3661,Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate essence of garlic. <BR> So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way? <BR> There is one other thing. I'd buy yourself a gun if I were you. If you start becoming sensitive to the daylight if you start becoming thirsty regardless of much you've had to drink -- then I suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself. Better that than the alternative.
3662,Look here I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me... <BR> That's too bad. <BR> I thought you said you never knew your father. <BR> I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death? <BR> I don't know what you're talking about man. I swear. This is some weird shit you're telling me... and I don't know how come you're doing it.
3663,Your ex-wife. <BR> I know who she is.  Take a message.
3664,Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers? <BR> Have a look at this.
3665,Uhuh uhuh what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho. <BR> You could've asked the cop if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
3666,Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence... <BR> Come on Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him remember? Or didnt I hear you right?
3667,Maybe he lives in this this Belvedere Ohio too! Maybe he saw her every day and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then - <BR> Starling - <BR> But then he had to cover up make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting! <BR> The market in Lecter hints is way down today okay? I've got two good men dead in Memphis and three civilians. I've got -
3668,I know this place -- it's a blood bank. <BR> Owned by vampires. There's one of these in every major city and just like Domino's they always deliver.  You telling me you're ready to walk through that door?
3669,"Futterman!...He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos...Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would... <BR> Finish your breakfast... <BR> I gotta catch up with him, Laurie! <BR> Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze... <BR> But that's Sweet-face -- your own good horse."
3670,Yeah. <BR> You know Libbets I really feel you know like a real connection to you -- <BR> Yeah but you don't even know me really. <BR> Sure I do you know like your aura. That you give off. <BR> My what? <BR> It's like very positive and I feel a real special feeling because you really -- <BR> And I have a special feeling too because I do. It's special. <BR> You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you -- <BR> And I have a feeling for you too because you're just like -- I feel for you like you're -- you're just like --
3671, <BR> How many men have I talked to? <BR> Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me! <BR> You said in L.A. anything goes. <BR> I was talking about what you could wear!
3672,But being out of the game gives me time to write. <BR> To what? <BR>  <BR> Hiya fellow ... What were they? <BR> What? <BR>  <BR>  <BR> Sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. Aren't you exaggerating a bit Dick? Call it three-and-a-half maybe four ... <BR> Let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis Rocky ... <BR> Whatcha mean by that? <BR> You know: how the voters are gonna play your divorce.
3673,I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969. <BR> So? <BR> I thought she was a killer too. You know... that she chopped up a bunch of teenage camp counselors... before she was decapitated.
3674,In a hurry are we? <BR> I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling? <BR> Bad news. <BR> People pay good money for that? <BR> I'm just a messenger.
3675,This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is. <BR> He told us it's in the Buick. <BR> We don't know which Buick do we? <BR> Well why'd you shoot him? <BR> I had to shoot him! It was the only decent thing to do.
3676,So how did you get hooked up with these guys? <BR> Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's? <BR> The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information. <BR> So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed? <BR> They're not nice people.
3677,This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again? <BR> Kinship. <BR> Kinship. And what's here? <BR> Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
3678,Ah... He certainly has something sir. <BR> Very pleased you've taken him in David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe it really identifies you as a team player. <BR> Yes although I really..... thank you.  Yes it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited. <BR> Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through will you? <BR> You're not going to .... <BR> Sack him?  David what else can I do?  This business is not repeat not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this morning?
3679,Then it's our asses isn't it? <BR> And we'll all have to go to work for a living.
3680,Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly like... exactly like... <BR> I will answer all your questions. But first soap water and a razor.
3681,Charlie! <BR> I do this for you and you'll leave me and my guys alone. Be the fuckin' Boss of all the other Bosses but we are gonna be our own Bosses.
3682,It can be documented that he displayed the... <BR> This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny. <BR> There was a group of Girlscouts here from Indiana last month.  One of them expressed an interest in a Frederick Remington bust.  The president took her into the oval Office for a period...
3683,You slept with her! <BR> You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no... <BR> You put everything on the line because you... <BR> You slept with the fucker!!
3684,I had a dream once where I was... There was like knights in it and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there but he's horrible all white and he's always... trying to kill me. <BR> Lothos.
3685,Ah to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man. <BR> Oh by the way my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes. <BR> Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five. <BR> And Abdul and Carl and Sacha they stay with the place or I don't sell. <BR> Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them. <BR> Well so long.
3686,Jeanne listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own.  We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church who never closes her arms to those who would return to her.  But we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.  Take heed of this charitable admonition for if you persist in refusing our help then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers and I think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.  So now... will you please recite Our Lord's Prayer? <BR> Not unless you hear my confession.
3687,Your guitar is named Kimber? <BR> Yeah. <BR> That's all right. My axe is named Roosevelt. After Franklin not Ted. Franklin was the hot one with the polio.
3688,The threat of Nuc1ear Terrorism has been quelled.  We are in <u>contaot</u> with the Albanian Premier who assures me and this government <u>credits</u> his assurances that his country does not wish us ill and <u>has</u> not.  That the threat which we perceived was not of his wish or of his making. <BR> CAIN MOUTHING ALONG WITH THE SPEECH SHE LOOKS DOWN AND WE SEE WRITTEN ON HER COPY. of his making  <BR> AS WE LOOK UP WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH. <BR> From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents... <BR> ON CAIN AS SHE LOOKS AROUND.
3689,As they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes.  To feel it to know it is to be in touch with the will of every living thing. <BR> I do not think I like the sound of that. <BR> It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be. <BR> I feel hardly nothing. <BR> You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned. <BR> But why be so concerned about me? <BR> This power is divided amongst you me and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some like you and he have more.  Much more. <BR> And you? <BR> I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last then perhaps my life has meant something. <BR> I am not ready for this. <BR> You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them. <BR> Of course. <BR> You are young inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity all love. <BR> That is not me. <BR> With the proper tools Conor a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one.
3690,You can't mean that. <BR> Come with me Susan.  I want to show you something.
3691,These are hard times Tom. <BR> Yeah. Great isn't it? <BR> Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me. <BR> Look up Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives. <BR> Our mission is coffee Tom. A shot of the bull Puerto Rican espresso. <BR> Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.
3692,What kind of gun is that? <BR> My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force. <BR> How close do you have to be? <BR> Forty yards.  Less maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down. <BR> Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill?
3693,California Illinois Florida New Hampshire--all the major Democratic primary states.  Why does everything you play sound the same? <BR> --'cause I only know four chords--
3694,She should not have done this Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably -- <BR> I don't know what you're talking about Howard. <BR> Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people. <BR> Jesus.
3695,Where are you going? <BR> I'm taking a shower. <BR> Need any company? <BR> No. <BR> Want a blow job? <BR> Good night Cecile. <BR> Prude.
3696,I would like to thank you for your hospitality.  If you are ever in Paris here is my number. <BR> Cool.
3697,I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint? <BR> You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest most despicable most reprehensible form of reptilian swine-- <BR> There's no such thing. <BR> What? <BR> Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine. <BR> Who cares?!  You hired an actor?? <BR> I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that? <BR> No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
3698,You're a family man Frankie? <BR> Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time wasn't it? <BR> An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy and then in one dumb moment what does he do? <BR> I don't know Toyota. What does he do? <BR> And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living. We're always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don't want to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it.
3699,Don Maranzano. Welcome. <BR> I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see. <BR> Good liquor draws a good crowd. <BR> I must know more of you my son. <BR> Not a lot ta know.
3700,Jill please it's alright. Nothing happened. <BR> I want to go home. <BR> Okay let's go home then.
3701,--and he says Chapin hired Segretti-- <BR> --well and good but when will he say it on the record. <BR> He just did.
3702,No. <BR> Nevertheless I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.
3703,I apologize sir I'm having a bad day... <BR> A bad month.  You did the exact same thing to me last week.
3704,Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation. <BR> I see the truth of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER  Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will he be ours to control?  You know when people speak the truth?
3705,The 2-3.  Homicide. <BR> A hot shot huh? <BR> Nah just working the job. <BR> I hear that. <BR> As a matter of fact I caught a case that goes back to your day...one of the Nightingale murders.
3706,I must say you look very good Mr. Chairman. <BR> Looks can be deceiving ... <BR> We know you've taken a great risk in inviting us here.
3707,Okay okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.? <BR> Thanks for playing Freb. That's a gimme ...
3708,How did you know? <BR> Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up. <BR> You used me as bait?! <BR> It worked didn't it? <BR> But he could've -- <BR> He didn't. Get over it.
3709,Well where are you from? <BR> I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know. <BR> Of course you don't know. <BR>  <BR> Because in my life it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that. <BR> Well you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.
3710,...What do you mean you decided not to park here? <BR> Yeah I just came in. I decided not to park here.
3711,You're somewhere else where? <BR> Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this. <BR> Uh-huh. And? <BR> You're right you know. We don't have much time.
3712,Totally stale.  And the ushers are like the acne patrol.  We're thinking Pavilion.  Sitch? <BR> Sounds toasty.  We're going Pavilion.
3713,We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims. <BR> The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
3714,-- go -- take the van! -- <BR> -- the hotel -- how far? --
3715,Fuck off man.  It's just a fish. <BR> No Phil.  It's a mammal.
3716,Alan these aren't bones anymore. <BR> We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.
3717,Look Tom we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station. <BR> What club? <BR> Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...? <BR> I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you...
3718,This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris. <BR> Thank you. <BR> You have something for me?
3719,She's jus' wore out that's all. <BR> I shore would like to stop here a while an' give her some res' but we on'y got 'bout forty dollars left. I won't feel right till we're there an' all workin' an' a little money comin' in.
3720,I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life. <BR> Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you! <BR> They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history without philosophy without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks the Babylonians the Hebrews the Numidians the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them who we are! <BR> You teach them! <BR> That's what I'm going to do.  That's what I'm going to do...
3721,So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big pińata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - <u>hundreds</u> of 'em. <BR> A pińata. That's a <u>great</u> idea!
3722,Whatever do you mean? <BR> The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins? <BR> What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of killing them. I woke up one morning and thought I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive. There are so few things in this life we can prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't have to...
3723,This is a new car then sir? <BR> It certainly is officer. Still got that smell! <BR> You're required to display temporary tags either in the plate area or taped inside the back window. <BR> Certainly - <BR> Can I see your license and registration please? <BR> Certainly.
3724,I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle then he corked it sealing it tight and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle and in less than two minutes got that cork off slid inside and ate that fish. <BR> What the hell are you talking about? <BR> Us...I'm talking about us... We're the fish.
3725,You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health. <BR> So Buzz was stooling for you guys. <BR> You call it stooling we call it cooperating. Breeze looks under Theo's car.
3726,Yeah. So who the fuck does? <BR> Come on. Tell us Shitface.
3727,Hope you get to where you're going. <BR> Thanks. Hope you do too. <BR> By the way you're getting a hell of a car there mister.
3728,Who is your User program? <BR> Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass? <BR> All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.
3729,Mary whenever it's possible tax- deductible or not I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.  Even respectability. <BR> You make respectability sound... disrespectful. <BR> I'm all for it! It requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating- out... otherwise though it's only hard work.  But if I can see you touch you even as simply as this... I won't mind.
3730,What's the problem? <BR> I want to talk now. <BR> After you drink to love and happiness forever. <BR> Now. <BR> After.
3731,How's it feel Tommy? <BR> Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear? <BR> Looks like you done it. <BR> I kinda thought so. Felt like it. <BR> Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella. <BR> They killed Casy first. <BR> That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust. <BR> They know what--this fella looks like? <BR> They know he got hit in the face. <BR> I'm sorry Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin' no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it. <BR> It's awright Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you. <BR> I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks. <BR> Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan' but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off an' little fellas come an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be this-a-way? Growin' up wild an' Ruthie too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me. <BR> Okay Ma. I shouldn't though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.
3732,Hello Jane. Its me. <BR> Really? And how are you eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of... <BR> Carlos De Moraes? <BR> Yes. How did... <BR> Thank you Jane.
3733,What're you laughing about? <BR> Napoleon... small.
3734,Well don't be shy. I got the address here. Anytime you need it. Room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like. <BR> Suits me.
3735,I heard that. <BR> Dodge you gotta get on those repairs.
3736,Oops I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class huh? <BR> No what does that mean find the clitoris?
3737,I know. I know. <BR> Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke. <BR> Look! I don't feel BAD about it. I just feel ILL.
3738,Man that movie gets better every time I see it! <BR> Yeah but you know what? That whole part about lighting farts is bullshit. You can't do that.
3739,Thanks to God you are alive. <BR> I the best knight in the world bested! This is a great day for my search is over. I love you my King.
3740,Goodbye Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow. <BR> Uh-huh.
3741,Don't be an ass Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you can't you see that? <BR> He's crazy. <BR> No he's not. You are. <BR> You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew. <BR> It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better. <BR> Fuck you kid.
3742,Sorry. <BR> What did you do to them? <BR> It's not what you think. <BR> How young? <BR> Between ten and twelve. Once a nine- year-old told me she was eleven. Once a fourteen-year-old told me she was twelve. I always asked how old they were.
3743,Is that better? <BR> Perfect Mr. President. <BR> I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts General. <BR> There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging.. <BR> What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.
3744,Always? <BR> What?  Oh damn near yes. Unless the animal's sick or something.  And the steam rising off it like that in the morning. That's life Mr. Gittes. Life.
3745,This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education Grady. <BR> Would Walter really press charges? <BR> It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit prickly this morning.
3746,Like it or not Cyrus that's my name. Cole. Just like yours. <BR> Now ask him who his mother was.
3747,You sure about that? <BR> Would you like to sell it? <BR> No -- no thanks. <BR> I'd give you a very good price.
3748,You're an artist. I'm a craftsman. <BR> Press a button and they give us money. <BR> Ride with me. We need a haircut.
3749,We look good this year. <BR> We'll kill Fairfax this year. <BR> I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus. <BR> Fuck him. <BR> Your first start at DB it's against Fairfax and you miss the fucking bus. <BR> What are we delivering? <BR> We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something and whatever it is is his business. <BR> Who is this fucking Ruiz? <BR> Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him. <BR> Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty tops? I'd kick his fucking ass. <BR> I gotta pick up the baby. <BR> Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid. <BR> I like it. <BR> It's not even yours. <BR> I like it.
3750,If it's real enough he'll believe it because deep down he'll want to. <BR> C!  Shit I'm sorry!
3751,Yeah Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. Tell you what let me be Mr. Purple. That sounds good to me I'm Mr. Purple. <BR> You're not Mr. Purple somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink.
3752,Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest. <BR> What? <BR> Well I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin' maybe.
3753,This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher don't you? <BR> I ain't no preacher anymore. <BR> All right you remember the *man* then.
3754,We're making too much of this. <BR> No we're not. <BR> I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life. <BR> We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?
3755,How's it going upstairs? <BR> Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
3756,There you are!  Man I don't know how to thank... <BR> Eric...You can't be like me. You have to be better. I'm not the guy you think I am... <BR> Of course you are. You don't know what I was like before I met you. You're like the best counselor ever.
3757,You think this is fucking funny?? <BR> No no it's just -- <BR> -- well here's a better one: you're fired. <BR> What? <BR> And here's your goddamn severance!
3758,The fuck you talking about? <BR> Even Robert E. Lee was a loser. <BR> He goin' crazy on us or what? <BR> Did you know the most brutal inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia? <BR> Really. And where was that old man? <BR> Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...
3759, <BR> Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates. <BR>  <BR> Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey I shouldn't be talking to you about this. <BR>  <BR> No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this? <BR>  <BR> A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
3760,If I was healthy I could take that away from you. <BR> Perhaps.  But you are not healthy and if you try I'll kill you.
3761,She pretends she's been sent by God! These charlatans -- it's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn them all! <BR> She says she'll be here tomorrow...! <BR> You mustn't see her my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine. <BR> What difference does it make where she comes from? <BR> 
3762,That's for sure. At the airport - that's where it was. At the airport there in one of those gift shops... Anyway you better take a break. <BR> Thanks. You are just a wonderful person.
3763,Joe you want me to shoot him for you? <BR> Shit you shoot me in a dream you better wake up and apologize.
3764,Nice place. <BR> He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes they're gone they have to ride.
3765,He was accused of jury tampering. <BR> Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks. <BR> Four cases in three years... <BR> The man's an ambulance chaser... <BR> ...tell me about this case. <BR> This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court. <BR> No -- we don't want this case in court. <BR> Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff. <BR> I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed. <BR> No. Absolutely and we're going to see that it is not. <BR> So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me. <BR> All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
3766, <BR> Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning. <BR> Jorge.  When I get out of here I'm going to sue his cheating ass off.
3767,"Mr. President, I don't know what to say.  As soon as we learned from the Secret Service you were en route, the Director was notified.  He should be here any minute. <BR> Where the hell is he? <BR> Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ... <BR> So ... let's go ... <BR> He told me to take you to his conference room. <BR> No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged. <BR> Then his office will be fine."
3768,Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean. <BR> And why's that? <BR> He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him.
3769,Thank you thank you thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen what did you say your name was? <BR> Dawson sir. <BR> Dawson huh? Was I very drunk last night? <BR> Drunk sir?
3770,You know Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there. <BR> There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book Lisa.
3771,No.   How much? <BR> I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.
3772,My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back I can get in the front and we roll out of here. <BR> What's in the back? <BR> Nothing this was my last delivery.
3773,What did you do? <BR> I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking. <BR> What? <BR> Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us. <BR> What are you referring to?
3774,You know that cheese is practically all chemicals. <BR> That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today? <BR> Shoot. <BR> Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove? <BR> Nothing really but it's interesting. they know each other. they seem to like each other.
3775,You saw him didn't you Dylan!? <BR> Coming for you...
3776,Let's have a quick word of prayer right here to thank the Lord for all this-- <BR> Oh let's not...
3777,Who the hell are you? <BR> I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons. <BR> Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned? <BR> General all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum and a trial is nowhere to be seen. <BR> Impossible!  Every citizen has a right to trial -- this is Rome!
3778,Pretty good. Sticking with hot water. <BR> Where's Mr MacCarron? <BR> San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well my boy it's come to a pretty pass hasn't it?
3779,This? <BR> They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle. <BR> What about? <BR> I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing  apple core. <BR> Apple core? <BR> Yeah.
3780,Bud I hate to tell you this but you're a genius!  Darien...lightning has struck! The lightbulb has been invented. Edison Da Vinci Einstein are watching... <BR> ...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours. <BR> You think I'm gonna broker the rest of my life... I'm going to be a giant Darien an entrepreneur in the Italian 15th century sense of the word -- a mover shaker.
3781,Nails? Really? <BR> No I mean the father! Who's the father Juno?
3782,Let me guess:  Another short circuit? <BR> Hi darling.
3783,Richard Richard we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you -- <BR> -- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship. <BR> Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened if you only knew the truth -- <BR> -- I wouldn't believe you no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.
3784,You hold great hope for this meeting. <BR> I can see no other hope for your planet. If the meeting should fail then I'm afraid there is no hope.
3785,What?  I'm not going anywhere! <BR> Oh yes you are! <BR> I get it.  You're the goon fetch boy.  The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose. <BR> That's right.
3786,Honey did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II? <BR> No I didn't. <BR> It says she was originally Schooner rigged but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic. <BR> Me too.
3787,Conor you and I we cannot be killed. <BR> What? <BR> We are immortal.
3788,Good going Slink!  Now just just tie it on to something! <BR> Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
3789,I really like you Mary. You know that. <BR> Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything. <BR> You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love. <BR> Thanks Stan.
3790,Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown? <BR> He's not a racehorse Bud he's a jumper. <BR> How would I know? I once bet a horse. He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five.
3791,"Son! -- Out of the water now! <BR> My boat's neat, dad! <BR> I want him out of the ocean."
3792,By the way  what happened to your leg? <BR> I was jaywalking.
3793,Look if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight -  At the University of Illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a St. Valentine's dance. <BR> We'll take it! <BR> You got it.  It's six dollars a man.  Be on the campus in Urbana at eight o'clock -
3794,...hell of a price for the country to pay. <BR> ...take a long view. <BR> ...what's the Long View? <BR> Your guy gets four more years in Washington...  ...it's only Nine More Days. <BR> Yes.  That's true.  But... <BR> Wilfred.  We've got <u>work</u> to do...
3795,Yeah?! <BR> Yeah -- when you're sixteen. <BR> Yuk yuk yuk -- funny Mom.
3796,Damn skippy you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds. <BR> Once! And she didn't die if you recall!
3797,... Can you... decipher this for us? <BR> Decipher? <BR> Yes. What do they... stand for? <BR> They're just words. <BR> Yes I understand  but where do you take them from? <BR> Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere. <BR> What are they? <BR> Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that. <BR> Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist. <BR> You mean like an ape?
3798,"Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers. <BR> OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink."
3799,Well if she can act she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation... <BR> I feel right now like there's one burning in me. <BR> When's the audition? <BR> A couple of weeks. <BR> I tell you what. Why don't I read with her? <BR> Would you? <BR> Anything to help you out Max. <BR> This is real cooperation. I appreciate it. <BR> Not at all. And you could do me a big favor if you would- <BR> All you got to do is name it. <BR> Give Eve Harrington job in you office.
3800,You can't tell your parents. <BR> Ok. <BR> Especially not your dad. <BR> I won't. <BR> It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time. <BR> You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight? <BR> Unless he makes a move during seventh period. <BR> Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time? <BR> I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go. <BR> Stag? <BR> Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on. <BR> I can't right now. <BR> Jody you have to go to the party. For your own safety.
3801,What do you think? <BR> Something too frightful to utter.
3802,Oh -- oh Miss Flaemmchen. It's you -- <BR> Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once -- Mr. Preysing -- <BR> Preysing?
3803,I didn't know you -- weren't well. <BR> It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me. <BR> They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent. <BR> You were right -- and I was wrong. There!  Did you ever think you'd hear me say that?  Spectacularly wrong. Instead of observing those animals I tried to control them.  I squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives.  Not their lives as man would have them behind electric fences but in the wild.  Behavior in their natural habitat the impossible dream of any paleontologist.  I could have had it but I let it slip away.  Thank God for Site B.
3804,Let me tell you guys a story. In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois. <BR> Elois? <BR> Yeah Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E. <BR> Where was she from Compton? <BR> No. She was from Ladora Heights.
3805,It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself. <BR> Okay. <BR> If not for me at least for Amy. <BR> Okay okay. <BR> You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones. <BR> I don't need one. <BR> Yes you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff. <BR> That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all. <BR> Yes I - yes I do. <BR> No you don't. <BR> How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it. <BR> Oh God. Oh God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
3806,Here <BR> What is it?  Why it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  Youyou had it pressed. <BR> Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time. <BR> Why you sweet thing you. Where'd you get it pressed?  <BR> Listen BratI'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself.
3807,What if someone else buys it in the meantime? <BR> Honey nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them well we might have to make a counter offer.  But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed.
3808,You? <BR> No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand. <BR> We too are brothers Macleod.  In fact you have more family than you think. <BR> Who are you? <BR> Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life. <BR> I learned my fill from Romeriz. <BR> Indeed you did.  And now it is time for you to pass on to others what you learned from him.
3809,Who exactly ARE you? <BR> What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson. <BR> And who IS Ted Nelson?
3810,Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around. <BR> You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
3811,Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner. <BR> Yeah? You sure? <BR> Go.
3812,He saw her at the Northern Care... <BR> ...and I have inquiries out to doctors experts in the field... there is of course a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent...
3813,So? <BR> I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty. <BR> I think we got a White House consultant linked to the bugging.
3814,So what do you say? Can we be friends? <BR> ...okay.
3815,Even after a little vacation they hassled him at the airport. <BR> Excuse me. <BR> I mean Frank Marino was there to meet him but so were the cops. This time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
3816,You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back! <BR> Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.
3817,Who told you to wear men's clothes? <BR> The clothes are not important... <BR> You also cut your hair short like a man and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  It proves your desire to deceive... <BR> It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers... <BR> So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man? <BR> I... submit to Our Lord. <BR> But will you also submit to the decision of the Church? <BR> It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?
3818,Yes I am. <BR> Are you willing to follow all His commandments? <BR> Yes... <BR> ... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
3819,What happened? <BR> Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine spinning and the beam broke. <BR> You're kidding. <BR> Snapped.  Buffy was you know on the upswing and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels. <BR> Oh my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit. <BR> Well that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
3820,Hello there Meadows![13] <BR> Who is it you wish to see sir? <BR> I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith. <BR> Pardon me Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening <BR> Oh a party! Great great! Jolly times and merry pranks. That's me. I'm a guy who loves parties. You know
3821,Hello Charlie.  Long time no see. <BR> What is it Spats?  What do you want here? <BR> Just dropped in to pay my respects. <BR> You don't owe me no nothing. <BR> Oh I wouldn't say that.  You were nice enough to recommend my mortuary to some of your friends...
3822,I don't know how you're used to doing things Marvosa but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me! <BR> Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
3823,It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world. <BR> I leave that in your hands. <BR> You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting? <BR> No -- not at all. <BR> What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police? <BR> My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house. <BR> I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy. <BR> I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting. <BR> One thing Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative? <BR> I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
3824,I read your teen beat manifesto. <BR> You did? <BR> I must say I found it rather appalling. <BR> That's a first. Most people praised me for it. <BR> Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced? <BR> I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions. <BR> Oh really? <BR> Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it? <BR> How do you know I've been with several women? <BR> A friend wrote me. <BR> Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip. <BR> I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
3825,About anybody but yourself. You never have. <BR> And you're a little fucking reject. <BR> Eat my ass!
3826,I'll be back ... <BR> Where are you going? <BR> Laying in supplies Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ... <BR> You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all I am still the chief suspect. <BR> No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well. <BR> But -- <BR> Oh and by the way I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder. <BR> If you'd been through what I have you wouldn't --
3827,What kind of trouble -- ? <BR> Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared. <BR> And you got some Italians -- ? <BR> Six or seven... <BR> I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic but it's mine ... <BR> I understand -
3828,Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first? <BR> As per mother's instructions. <BR> Do we always follow Mother's instructions? <BR> For a man in my position -- <BR> Just what is your position if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work? <BR> They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself. <BR> I have no choice. Why should you risk your life? <BR> After our fencing match I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea? <BR> No thanks. <BR> I meant me.
3829,We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking. <BR> Is there any sort of risk of brain damage? <BR> Well technically the procedure itself is brain damage but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.
3830,Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like... <BR> Passion... <BR> Boom!!! Boom!!!
3831,"Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it. <BR> You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you... <BR> To tell you the truth, I can't believe I've made it this far. It may not be Europe, but I just know there's something special out there for me..."
3832,No...no you're wrong. <BR> I'm only trying to help you.
3833,I've never seen a dead body before. <BR> Alex I think it's time for you to stop.
3834,You know how I feel? <BR> My mind's not on guessing games.
3835,That was an egg? <BR> Three days ago it was. <BR> What do these replicators do to people? <BR> With enough exposure the same thing they do to everything else.
3836,What's Beynon got set up? <BR> Small town small bank big money.
3837,"I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic. <BR> Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully? <BR> I just did. You're buying."
3838,"Lyla's very nice. <BR> Yes, she is. <BR> She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me. <BR> She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again? <BR> Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up... <BR> Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago. <BR> You told me that two hours ago."
3839,What's he joking around for?    He's been shot. <BR> He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
3840,I miss Orville Redenbacher already -- <BR> Okay okay. The important thing to remember is to Think Slow. Take your time. It may not seem like it but the night is long. Long enough. Just think slow and think smart...
3841,I would like some fresh straw. <BR> Louis... water and fresh straw!
3842,Who are you?  IRA? <BR> Not likely.  Once yeah I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it and I'm a cash oriented girl if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun same as the rest of you and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
3843,Don't give me that look. <BR> What look? <BR> You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look. <BR> We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way. <BR> I don't want to hear about it okay? That's three jobs for the night. It's over. Three jobs and time for a drink. Six am the cocktail hour. Pass the bottle; I know you're holding.
3844,There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when -- <BR> What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt the killing that's what the Thirst is really about. <BR> But you use blood banks -- <BR> Only as a last resort. Preserved blood is inferior. There's no flavor left to it no life.  Fortunately I've found a way around that particular obstacle.
3845,Nothing. <BR> Is there a mutual feeling between you two? <BR> No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him? <BR> Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep but it's mostly bullshit. <BR> What do you mean? <BR> Well a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded. <BR> I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him. <BR> From who? <BR> I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.
3846,Thank you. <BR> Nothing really... <BR> The kid - junior that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her... <BR> I can always get a fresh one. Karen - you're a Gibson girl...
3847,Gee this is a surprise Mr. Gittes. <BR> Call me Jake. How is everything? <BR> Just sitting down to supper Jake. Care to join us? <BR> No thanks. <BR> How about a glass of wine? Honey this is...
3848,What about? <BR> About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --
3849,I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen. <BR> Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people... <BR> Buddy it's not your fault and it's not your decision. <BR> I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.
3850,If that was your knife Muddy I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her. <BR> Where'd she get you? <BR> She just plan misunderstand me--I was tryin' to give her my knife I was just reachin' to touch her hand. But I understand if she misunderstand me--it's all my fault ain't that right?
3851,We'll be food dickheads! <BR>  <BR> You gotta be with me on this.
3852,"Mose...try to remember!...You were in Scar's camp... <BR> Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away... <BR> Scar! Where's he holed in? <BR> Seven Fingers...ay-eh...Seven..."
3853,Go away! <BR> Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries ...
3854,Do you deny that there's an attraction between us? <BR> I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends. <BR> You don't find me cute? Come on look at these muscles.
3855,This is terrific work if you like rejection. <BR> I never scared anyone before. <BR> It's not us they were scared before we got there.  What do we know? <BR> Facts or theory? <BR> Anything you've got. <BR> We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked. <BR> And that something's got to be more than just Hunt Liddy and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know? <BR> I just wish we knew when someone would talk to us that's all.
3856,I'm so very sad. <BR> Why? We did pretty well wouldn't you say? <BR> Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy... <BR> I told you not to read all that crap! <BR> Protect life... Until death.
3857,Yeah? <BR> Where are you? <BR> We're by Ozone... <BR> You set to go - <BR> What do you think? <BR> Alright stay on the phone.
3858,Now that's teamwork. <BR> I should have let him kill you. <BR> You know he would have done you too. <BR> I knew I couldn't trust you.
3859,I never hurt them. Never. <BR> Twelve years in prison? <BR> The judge had a thing about sex offenders. Later I heard his daughter had been raped. If I hadn't had a good lawyer it would have been twenty- five to thirty.
3860,How dare you...  You dont know this tape belongs to my brother do you Mr Lombard? <BR> The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything Mrs De Moraes. <BR> No. The question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here Mr Lombard. <BR> Excuse me? <BR> Get out of my house. Youre fired Mr Lombard. <BR> Perhaps I should come back when youre... <BR> No. Youre fired! Get out of my house. And take your sick tape with you...
3861,"You follow me out here for a reason? <BR> Yeah, I did."
3862,You really don't need anyone? <BR>  <BR> Why doesn't it scare you? <BR> I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind. <BR> Do you ever regret it? The divorce I mean. <BR> No. <BR> Do you ever regret not having a family? <BR> Not everybody's supposed to have a family. <BR> But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people? <BR> I told you I love other people. <BR> But no one in particular. <BR> No. But I love them just the same. <BR> But it's not the same. <BR> That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper. <BR> No I'm just saying -- <BR> I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie. <BR> Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world. <BR> Do you want to leave your husband?
3863,Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif. <BR> Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
3864,He said if it vanished he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test. <BR> So I'm still ...
3865,...So I'm tendin' bar there at Ecklund & Swedlin's last Tuesday and this little guy's drinkin' and he says 'So where can a guy find some action - I'm goin' crazy down there at the lake.'  And I says 'What kinda action?' and he says 'Woman action what do I look like' And I says 'Well what do I look like I don't arrange that kinda thing' and he says 'I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake' and I says 'Well this ain't that kinda place.' <BR> Uh-huh. <BR> So he says 'So I get it so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin'' only he doesn't use the word jerk. <BR> I unnerstand. <BR> And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says 'What do ya think about that?'  So I says 'Well that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.' <BR> Ya got that right. <BR> And he says 'Yah that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.' And then he says 'Geez I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.' <BR> White Bear Lake? <BR> Well Ecklund & Swedlin's that's closer ta Moose Lake so I made that assumption. <BR> Oh sure. <BR> So ya know he's drinkin' so I don't think a whole great deal of it but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in so I called it in. End a story. <BR> What'd this guy look like anyways? <BR> Oh he was a little guy kinda funny- lookin'. <BR> Uh-huh - in what way? <BR> Just a general way. <BR> Okay well thanks a bunch Mr. Mohra. You're right it's probably nothin' but thanks for callin' her in. <BR> Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow. <BR> Yah got a front movin' in. <BR> Ya got that right.
3866,Look I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment but if help doesn't come soon I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail I just don't wanna die. <BR> You're not gonna fucking die all right? <BR> I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt and I'm hurt bad. <BR> It's not good... <BR> Hey bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment but I've got my senses back now. The situation is I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention I'm gonna die. <BR> I can' take you to a hospital. <BR> Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe. <BR> Lie back down and try to - <BR> I'm going to die! I need a doctor! I'm begging you take me to a doctor.

He says I should visit him sometimes. <BR> Sometime? <BR> Yeah like maybe never. <BR> But what are you going to do? <BR> Well I might go to Dartmouth. <BR> Dartmouth?! <BR> I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it. <BR> I can't believe it! But what about Doug? <BR> There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them. <BR> Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his loss.

3876,Our faithful friend is still there. <BR> Victor please don't go to the underground meeting tonight. <BR> I must. Besides it isn't often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife.
3877,Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can... <BR> What do you mean? <BR> Get the... midnight... express. <BR> What's that?

3885,Where are you two going? <BR> We're going to get my little girl.
3886,Maybe I ought to think about getting another job. <BR> Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
3887,What do you want from me? <BR> It's what you want from me.
3888,Shoes Hats.... <BR> The special hats of the Special Anti-terrorist detachment of the Border Patrol.
3889,Nigger please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you? <BR> We're square. <BR> Thanks man. You need anything you call. <BR> Thanks. <BR> You rode?
3890,Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication. <BR> I don't think it is a duplication. <BR> It has to be. <BR> And this?
3891,Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional!  AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY! <BR> Worse... you're in Texas. <BR> Well I should be in FLORIDA now! If Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed you wouldn't be here and I'd be on my way to the Keys. On my boat RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!! Re-ti red!
3892,On that one is beautiful. Look at their expressions. As if the camera weren't on them at all. As if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling. <BR> He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories entire histories captured in moments. <BR> I bet you could do a book. <BR> No. I couldn't. <BR> Why do you say that? <BR> Because I already tried once.
3893,You alright? <BR>  <BR> I guess. <BR>  <BR> Pup corn? <BR>

3895,They just landed in the desert. <BR> How much time is left?
3896,Who's that sitting in your car? <BR> James Leer. <BR> What's he doing out there? <BR> I'm sort of helping him work through some issues.
3897,This is wrong...it's like we cheated... <BR> I know...  But Dad you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right. <BR> I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy. <BR> But we can we can do it together. Spirit and guts remember? <BR> Johnny I know but...
3898,Are you all right? <BR> Oh yes I'm fine thanks just fine. <BR> Would you like to talk about it? <BR> No.
3899,Red sky at night sailor's delight. <BR> Red sky in morning sailor take warning.
3900,"Where you headed, Betty? <BR> Los Angeles, California. <BR> And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy. <BR> Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas. <BR> I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday and goddamnit, I went. <BR> Did you love it? <BR> Sure I loved it! It was great."
3901,Yes I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time why didn't you leave me then? <BR> I meant to but something always held me up. I love you very much Ilsa.
3902,Alvy you were... Alvy you were just great I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat. <BR> C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful. <BR> Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references too. <BR> Are yuh? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Well the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
3903,Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here- <BR> They can always grab oranges off trees. This you can't do in Times Square...
3904,You don't understand. <BR> Then help me understand. You know you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and if so it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously. <BR> This has nothing to do with that.
3905,Margo nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking Eve in... <BR> I'm so happy you're happy.
3906,Up and down up and down! <BR> I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm. <BR> People were gettin' bloody noses - - things on your head - - aneurisms - -
3907,Hey Brat!  The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step. <BR> Are you talking to me! <BR> Yeah. Come onwe're stopping here for the night.
3908,Tom? You can come on. They gone. <BR> We got to get outa here right away. Ever'body here? Where's Uncle John?
3909,Ya see something down there Chief? <BR> Uh - I just I think I'm gonna barf. <BR> Geez you okay Margie? <BR> I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
3910,All right. Jesus you fuckers are pushy. <BR> Hey man I hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major.
3911,After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window. <BR> Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
3912,It's like jelly. <BR> There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
3913,Yes uh... <BR> You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know you don't need... <BR> Uh I have a plane to catch to Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings?
3914,I'm the one sent you to Toronto Bernstein-- <BR> --that was awhile ago-- <BR> 
3915,Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love? <BR> Me? <BR> Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy. <BR> Maybe.  Suresure I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl I'd  Yeah but where you going to find hersomebody that's realsomebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more.
3916,I was hoping you could tell me. <BR> You're getting yourself into terrible trouble my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I. <BR> I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole. <BR> Where? <BR> In your operation. <BR> I'm warning you for the last time Steed: whoever's behind all this looks like Mrs. Peel walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
3917,So what's the problem? <BR> There is no problem. <BR> So why did you idiots bring me here? ... I'm in the middle of making a picture.
3918,Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines Chin and I are staying here to finish the job... <BR> Did you clear this? <BR> With who?
3919,I crashed your party. <BR> Pretty shallow of you. <BR> That's me. <BR> I'm glad you came. <BR> Yeah you look like you're having a swell time.
3920,Hi ya fellas.  To infinity and beyond! <BR> Hey look!  It's Buzz! <BR> Yeah hey Buzz.  Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake.  Gimme five man!
3921,THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them. <BR> Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have... <BR> NO!
3922,Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you. <BR> But now that you have it - <BR> I want to keep it forever. I want to love you the way I do now the rest of my life. Don't you understand -- we'll lose it if we leave. I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one. All I can do is try to hold onto to both. Help me. Help me not lose loving you.
3923,Yeah but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka. <BR> It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
3924,Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry? <BR> I just wanted to come here. <BR> To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything but why Denny's? <BR> This Denny's. <BR> Okay. Why this Denny's?
3925,Look it was just a job.  Nothing personal ya know?  I play my part improvise a little.  That's what I'm good at. <BR> I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge. <BR> Nobody knows pal.  Nobody gets the big picture...  Jason Tommy cut it out!
3926,A bad heart. <BR> I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit and we're gonna finish it.
3927,Then you'd be out of a job. <BR> Gladly Caesar. <BR> Or perhaps into a new one.  But here's to your God and the courage of our legions...
3928,Awwww. Worried about my feelings are you? Well there's a new twist. <BR> Don't joke around little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
3929,... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music Dick ... <BR> Uh is your mother ... still alive? <BR> Yeah she lives in Dallas ... <BR> She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
3930,"If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see? <BR> Israel doesn't have a King. <BR> Then what do they have? <BR> They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something. <BR> I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot. <BR> What's your point? <BR> Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right? <BR> The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies. <BR> There's my point exactly. <BR> What? What's your point? <BR> Take Mexico. <BR> What? <BR> Lock up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. The whole country picks up and takes Mexico."
3931,Going to make a little stop back home pick up my shirts show him a little treat. <BR> See y'at the Finish Line. <BR> Tell'em to fly the Inaugural Speech past me.
3932,No... <BR> Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged. <BR> Oh okay. So... how are you feeling? <BR> Happy? Oh you mean like physically. I'm good. Look I have a snooze button now!
3933,Interesting. <BR> I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
3934,She's good. <BR> I guess it was a long time ago. <BR> Come on let's get out of here.
3935,Where's his boat then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself that's for damn sure. <BR> She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
3936,You're sure? <BR> Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker retired M.D.
3937,Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you? <BR> I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now if you don't want me to keep on hurting you it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me where did they go? <BR> I swear man I don't know. They packed up and left a half hour ago.  All I got is one of their phone numbers in Paris.
3938,Oh I suppose you would've just let them take over.  These aren't fraternity pranks John.  It's anarchy.  A revolution! <BR> I don't know if I'd go that far sir. <BR> Why not? <BR> Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at. <BR> I will not go down as the first American president to lose a war! Going into Cambodia bombing Hanoi bombing Laos -- it buys us time so we can get out and give the South Vietnamese a fighting chance.
3939,I got poked around... here and there. <BR> Which brother did this? <BR> All three -- in chronological order. <BR> You must hate your brothers. <BR> I love my brothers. <BR> No you don't. <BR> I love all of them. They're strong gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you. <BR> You never asked them about it? <BR> Are you serious? <BR> Not ever? <BR> Not ever.
3940,Hell they even kicked me outa vo- tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide rule. <BR> I can show you how to use a slide rule.
3941,You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting-- <BR> Giovanni. <BR> Huh? <BR> That's exactly what you are.
3942,There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens. <BR> He's my client and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses.
3943,Revenge is a dish best served cold... well it's payback time sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture then he got fired... <BR> I don't understand. <BR> Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you sport to give me the missing half of the picture... <BR> Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out I could go to jail. It's inside information isn't it? <BR> Inside information. Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ. You mean that?  I'm afraid sport unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business...
3944,Excuse me but... <BR> This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?
3945,I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.' <BR> Then you're saying there's no negligence based on my question? <BR> I... given the limits of your question that's correct. <BR> The Doctors were not negligent. <BR> I... um...
3946,Caesar lives for these moments.  He tells me it's just the business but I know it's more than that.  He likes it.  The violence.  I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars.  He says they remind him who he his.  They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey. <BR> Mickey? <BR> He's the part of the business that the rest of them pretend to be. |But Mickey doesn't like it like they do.  I suppose that's why he's good at it.
3947,The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE CLITORIS!! <BR> Stan your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them. <BR> Wait you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me. <BR> There are more important matters right now... <BR> NO WAY DUDE!

3950,Freddie do you have something to say? <BR> What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else. <BR> I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce just off the Corso. <BR> 
3951,Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type. <BR> You're not.
3952,Shall we draw up the papers or is our handshake good enough? <BR> It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry it'll have to do.
3953,There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does. <BR> Ok. <BR> Hide your laptop here. <BR> No. <BR> You can't bring it. <BR> I'm not leaving it here.

3956,Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh -- <BR> Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once too. <BR> With the same friend?
3957,And the Father replies? <BR> That's the line I can't ever for the life of me remember. I just can't get it.

My Houston contact has always been very reliable. <BR> And then we're gonna do her right here. Right? <BR> You're always so coarse... Do her right here."""" Let's just see what happens okay?  """"I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day. There are no words that quite express; My gratitude or happiness.

I wish I could say this to my mother's face but I can't anymore."""""""
3969,What is it? <BR> It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of.  Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.

If you had it in you to pull that trigger you would have done it a long time ago.  If I was you I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home.

3983,That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you. <BR> No he didn't. <BR> What? How can you say that? He's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval...Jacket. He's probably the one who killed you.
3984,Heard of them. <BR> They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case. <BR> It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves we drop the bag and we all get back to our lives. <BR> And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
3985,Sexual assault Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about. <BR> What I know is what I told you. <BR> Let me tell you what I know Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt huh? <BR> So what? <BR> So what'd you do about it Daryl? <BR> Nothing.
3986,I read George Jean Nathan every week. <BR> Also Addison deWitt. <BR> Every day. <BR> You didn't have to tell me.
3987,Let me hear you say that! I so unhappy she runned away that I killed myself-- that what happen here ain't that right? <BR> Right?
3988,Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom? <BR> No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are. <BR> Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true? <BR> Yes. <BR> I figured I'd ask you... <BR> I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you finding out I was in there... doesn't it? <BR> I told my dad before he died I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you? <BR> We don't know that. <BR> Are you gonna kill him? <BR> No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs. <BR> How did it happen? <BR> Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them. <BR> How? <BR> With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was... peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait. <BR> You went in the apartment? <BR> Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
3989,Our Deputy sleeps. <BR> Well? <BR> Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep. <BR> Does that mean we can't... <BR> No. I'm just procrastinating.  People hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night.  Come on.
3990,She won't go to St. Cloud's! <BR> Well we can't force her. It's her decision. <BR> You don't understand! It's her father... <BR> Mr. Rose *knows*? <BR> He's the *father*! He's her baby's father!
3991,Looks like a cheap hotel. <BR> Yeah... Only the room service is lousy.  Come on let me show you the tennis courts.
3992,I got Clawsen on hold-- <BR> --his dialing finger must be falling off-- <BR> --what do you think?-- <BR> --he went to her apartment and he told her--
3993,Frank.  Hey man.  You alright? <BR> I'm alright Gibby.
3994,I thought I'd be nervous but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed Teddy Bear. <BR> I do? I mean yeah I do. <BR> I have to admit I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now. <BR> Do it? <BR> You know...take the pictures?
3995,"Rosa, so you've met David? <BR> Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George! <BR> Oh, he does that.  It's this silly game he plays. Half the people who know him call him George."
3996,You mean before she sank. <BR> Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
3997,Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me I'd say the old fart wants to die. <BR> Where can I find him? <BR> The Peter Pan.
3998,I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything. <BR> That right? <BR> You can trust him... <BR> How long have you been married? <BR> Two years. <BR> Can he trust you? <BR> That's what matters isn't it?
3999,You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you. <BR> But you can't.
4000,Are you out of your mind? You scalped him! <BR> You told me how to do it! <BR> That was to get him to talk!  Get rid of that thing will you?
4001,It's exquisite - like a floating mansion. <BR> It's all right for a bachelor. <BR> What a beautiful fish. <BR> Caught him off Cape Hatteras. <BR> What is it? <BR> Oh - a member of the herring family. <BR> A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars? <BR> They shrink when they're marinated.
4002,So you're saying as long as that door stays locked we're okay? <BR> Hell NO!! The House will kill ya!
4003,We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes. <BR> But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
4004,_Answer_ me. <BR> We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
4005,Never was anybody like you... <BR> You can't take anything seriously. <BR> You're right.
4006,What are you doing? <BR> We're going to need some time. <BR> Who are you going to call?
4007,Sorry. <BR> Hospital clean. <BR> What? <BR> The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
4008,You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking stinky horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go over there and apologize.  Go! Get the fuck out of - <BR> Nicky I'm sorry.
4009,Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach? <BR> That's it!
4010,"So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee? <BR> They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate. <BR> Did you send anyone out there? <BR> You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now. <BR> Bad idea... <BR> You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work... <BR> You better handle what's in this garbage can first."
4011,Anybody says anything bad about Millie I'll break his neck. <BR> Hey guys I got a game to pitch.
4012,We must hurry Mrs. Peel ... <BR> Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now -- <BR> You didn't tell her?
4013,You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood.  Gushes out everywhere!  It's really impressive.  Fantastic!  Better than the real thing! <BR> So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold what do I get? <BR> You get to come alive again in the country! <BR> As what 'The Galloping Gladiator?!' <BR> The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit the small arenas relax live the good life! <BR> Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know Proximo who has better wine than you? Besides I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home. <BR> But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer! <BR> Pressures on eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window? <BR> It's absolutely not like that!  This is for your own good!  Come on get the rest of your armor on!

4018,We just thought that <BR> Don't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now stand up!

Part of it... or all of it? <BR> His face. <BR> Does he have hair? <BR> Yes. <BR> Is it long and hanging down? <BR> I'm more interested in what he says not what he looks like. <BR> But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said? <BR> Go on to the next question. <BR> That's enough!  You will answer the question... or face the consequences!

It's the mark of the patriot and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over. <BR> You're thinking with your gun Seamus and not your head... <BR> Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say is that understood?!?
4028,I was uh just getting ready to leave... <BR> Yo Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
4029,"Wait! <BR> No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining. <BR> No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information. <BR> Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell."
4030,We're down to seven minutes. <BR> Let's split up. You take the left side I'll take the right. We'll meet in front of the Cineplex.
4031,...Yah okay... <BR> Look Dad there is no fucking way -
4032,Oh Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother... <BR> When'd you get in? <BR> An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself but I didn't know he would be like like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay? <BR> I'm fine Kimmy. Fine. <BR> I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring. <BR> The ring... <BR> Grandmama's ring. The <u>engagement</u> ring. He asked me to send it to him -
4033,If you don't mind you fill in the names. That will make it even more official. <BR> You think of everything don't you? <BR> And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
4034,What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us? <BR> An answer I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping. <BR> And then where are we?
4035,I finally got through to Sloan--it was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the Grand Jury about Haldeman he was ready to only nobody on the Grand Jury asked him the goddamn question. <BR> So I guess you could say that we screwed up but we weren't wrong.
4036,Three four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money. <BR> Beats working. <BR> I was just going to sell it to friends.  I'm not a pusher honest.

I got a call today from Sally Doneghy... <BR> ...now who is that...? <BR> ...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them... <BR> Sally Doneghy now who is that? <BR> One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way... <BR> ...hey I don't need your charity... <BR> ...I get these people to trust you -- they're coming here tomorrow by the way -- I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file.
4038,Dennis-right uh uh... local kid probably would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night. <BR> Oh God you should've seen what I looked like then. <BR> Oh I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut. <BR> Then there was Jerry the actor.
4039,He's got a gun sir. <BR> What do you have a FUCKING WATER PISTOL?  Get him back!
4040,I said do you want some water? <BR> Oh... no thank you...

4042,You fucked me up! <BR> What? <BR> You gave me a 'D'. <BR> I'm sure you should have failed. <BR> I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
4043,I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS. <BR> You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight. <BR> ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN? <BR> WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress? <BR> Your mind is just twisted enough. I believe you'd do all this just to get a dip or two.
4044,My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino. <BR> Who's Monsieur Philipe? <BR> You don't know Monsieur Philipe?
4045,Where's Scully? <BR> I have answers for you. <BR> Is she alive? <BR> Yes.
4046,I'm Joe Galvin I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye case against St. Catherine Laboure. <BR> I told the guy I didn't want to talk to... <BR> I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber you know who he is? <BR> No. <BR> He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors Towler and Marx put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what? <BR> ...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me? <BR> I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big... <BR> I've got nothing to say to you. <BR> You know what happened. <BR> Nothing happened. <BR> Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
4047,You shoot alright. <BR> Gets the job done. <BR> All in the stomach though.  Your man might live. <BR> Not for long. <BR> Long enough to shoot back. <BR> Is that right? <BR> It's been known to happen. <BR> Why don't you go do better then...
4048,What's the matter? <BR> Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there his eyes so open. <BR> You loved the Baron didn't you? <BR> Yes -- <BR> So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was. <BR> Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that. <BR> He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him. <BR> I didn't like Preysing right off. <BR> Then why did you have anything to do with him? <BR> Money! <BR> Yes of course -- money! <BR> You don't understand that do you? <BR> Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me? <BR> What? <BR> You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel. <BR> Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always. <BR> Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more. <BR> Later? <BR> When I -- I'm ill Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until... <BR> Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days. <BR> Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing? <BR> Oh yes of course. <BR> Do you like me better? <BR> You're a good man Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man.
4049,Oh hell... <BR> Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>... <BR> Lemme talk to him.  Will?  Shoe? <BR> SUSIE...?  Are you alright...? <BR> Lemme talk to him.  Shoe?  Shoe...?  You in there...?
4050, <BR> No.  He's never asked me. <BR> Why don't you ask him? <BR> Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place? <BR> If you've never been out with him how do you know you don't want to go out with him?
4051,Ghosts killed your father? <BR> Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house... <BR> And you think it's in there? <BR> Accumulated evil... festering for decades...  But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.
4052,Did you send in all of the deposit checks? <BR> I think so. <BR> What do you mean you think so? <BR> I sent a lot of checks I'm not sure what all of them are. <BR> The wedding cake check? <BR> Sent it. <BR> Photographer? <BR> Sent it. <BR> Florist? <BR> Yup. <BR> Caterer? <BR> Yes. <BR> Hotel for my parents the tent the band the Judge... <BR> I think I forgot the tent. <BR> You forgot the tent? <BR> I think so. <BR> Why? <BR> Why what? <BR> Why did you forget the tent check? <BR> I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry. <BR> You can't play around with these tent people. <BR> I'm not playing around. I forgot. <BR> What else have you forgot? <BR> How could I know what else I forgot? <BR> I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith. <BR> Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's. <BR> Don't you dare. <BR> What? <BR> Don't you put this on me. Don't do it don't do it don't do it don't...
4053,I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories. <BR> Got a beer?
4054,Do you have bandages? <BR> In the bathroom.  Danny can you get them for us?
4055,I know I don't need to say this to you but I need to say it to you.  This is my job I have to do it. <BR> So I do it. <BR> No you don't and you know it. <BR> If our positions were reversed would you leave me? <BR> In a minute. <BR> I think not.
4056,Where's the surprise? <BR> You want your surprise? <BR> Yeah. I want it. <BR> Well come on then. It's back here.
4057,"Martin, what- <BR> It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way."
4058,Where have you been all day? <BR> I went to see Prof. Roth!  You know I had another one of those dreams last night.  I saw Tommi!
4059,Are you Treadstone? <BR> Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?
4060,And where the hell is Marvosa? <BR> He said he was following up some lead. <BR> Well let's get his ass to the garage!  Some lead...
4061,That boy you brought in he was shot wasn't he? <BR> Yes. <BR> He's dead huh? <BR> Yes. <BR> I think this place stinks. <BR> Our Lady of Misery. <BR> Did you see my father? <BR> No. <BR> It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling poking himself in the eye when he talks to me. <BR> He's working a double shift. <BR> Thing is I'm supposed to be the fuckup. The one on the stretcher in there--that's supposed to be me. With my parents crying out here. I got a lot of guilt you know what I mean?
4062,How've you been? <BR> Outrageous Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great. <BR> I was going to say... your eyes look a little red. <BR> I've been swimming Merv.
4063,Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker. <BR> A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
4064,Okay want to go with Mommy? <BR> What do you need? <BR> You get her?  Okay.  Well I need a lot. I need more than usual. <BR> Well why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there. <BR> Well I would you know Sam. It's just that... well I need more than that. I need twenty-five thousand.
4065,"No, I came here to drink... myself... you know... <BR> To death? <BR> Yes, that's right."
4066,Or your fucking wife you know. <BR> Or your fucking wife Jerry.
4067,He was a little older. Looked like the Marlboro man. <BR> Yah? <BR> Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros. <BR> Uh-huh. <BR> A subconscious-type thing. <BR> Yah that can happen. <BR> Yah.
4068,I think he has a little thing for Annie. <BR> Oh no no that's bullshit Max. He goes with that girl over there. <BR> Where?
4069,I can tell you what the nightmares are about.  They're about this...entity. Whatever you want to call it.  It's old very old and it's taken different forms in different times.  The only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for. <BR> What's that? <BR> Killing innocence one way or the other.
4070,99 years 241 days  15 hours and 20 minutes of no bowling. Alfie shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping it down. <BR> Find your bowler? <BR> Yeah but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup but his hands are trembling spilling some of the coffee. <BR>  <BR> Maybe I should have left the ball in the car.
4071,Whatever I'd say you'd carry on. Victor why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out? <BR> Apparently he has the letters. <BR> Yes? <BR> But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him money would.
4072,Can I get some paper and something to write with. <BR> What for?
4073,Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own... <BR> YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
4074, <BR> The cartoon? <BR>  <BR> Yeah. <BR> Well those guys share everything right? <BR> Right. <BR> And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything right? <BR> Right. <BR> And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl. <BR> Yeah that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring. <BR> 
4075,I've never met anyone like you Betty. <BR> I know that's why we were meant to be together... <BR> No I mean your dedication scares me... <BR> It's easy to be dedicated when you care about something... <BR>  <BR> ...but I love listening to you so that's okay... <BR> Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling... <BR> Well I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around.

It seems to me Karen that for some tine now you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general- <BR> I'm a human being I've got some! <BR> - and for my feelings in particular! For my play my career - and now for a frightened hysterical girl on the eve of her first night in the Theater!
4101,Don't go out if it's rough or any- thing huh?  We've had a lot of trouble. <BR> Okay okay.
4102,"I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know. <BR> Now mount up, son..."

4105,Straight-A brainiac! <BR> Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
4106,Have your children been deaf since birth? <BR> Yes -- yes they have. It was a real shock at first especially since my daddy's a preacher but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here. <BR> When did you start singing? <BR> When I was little in church. <BR> Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir? <BR> Yes it is -- <BR> Well can you tell me why? <BR> It just is. <BR> How long have you been with them? <BR> About three years. <BR> And before? <BR> Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see. <BR> Do you ever do any writing? <BR> No I don't. <BR> Are you a close friend of Haven's? <BR> No mostly his wife's. She's in Paris France right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him. <BR> Do you like him? <BR> He's a member of our congregation.
4107,I'm done Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working. <BR> Yeah. <BR> I want to enjoy my little time left with you. <BR>  <BR> Do you remember what we talked about? <BR> Naomi I guess. <BR> Yeah. <BR> What was I wearing? <BR> God I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper. <BR> Egad were you horrified? <BR> No! I think you were wearing that black dress y'know with the buttons.
4108,Oh yes!  Yes! <BR> Oh baby! <BR> Make me a woman!  Yes!  Make me a woman!
4109,Look I'm sorry about the face. <BR> Job hazard. Debbie Salt stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions? <BR> Fair enough. <BR> What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
4110,I cant think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. Whats your sisters number? <BR> Oh I... She just moved. Ive got her new... Its in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.
4111,Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing. <BR> REALLY? <BR> Really. <BR> And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
4112,What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore? <BR> Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack. <BR> So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name? <BR> Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself? <BR> So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County. <BR> She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas. <BR> Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again? <BR> David Ravell. <BR> God that sounds so familiar. Ravell Ravell... where's he out of? <BR> I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it. <BR> 
4113,And if I didn't want to come? <BR> I guess I'd ask you why. <BR> Because I don't think I'm crazy. <BR> You're not crazy.
4114,Say something Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes. <BR> Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.
4115,Yo! <BR> We may have some problems.  How is your schedule?
4116,The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor is you Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him? <BR> No. <BR> When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders their 'style' so to speak were you able to reconstruct his fantasies? And did that help you identify him?
4117,What are you doing? <BR> Checking out a theory. Just keep talking to him.
4118,How much did you have? <BR> A hundred grams. <BR> It's not fair!
4119,...Priest... <BR> You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.

4121,Want anything to drink? <BR> You? <BR> Yeah.  First Communion.  Aren't I a little angel?
4122,And you believed me?  But it wasn't my people who did it. <BR> How do we know that?

4124,"What about us? <BR> Have to pump her steady, s'all."
4125,I can't yet vouch for the amount unless you want me to sit here and count. <BR> No man that's fine. Just put that you took delivery.
4126,Whose son am I? <BR> You are the son of King Uther and the fair Igrayne... you are King Arthur.
4127,How much is it?  A few thousand at least.  A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it. <BR> Yes very lucky.
4128,What are you guys gonna do? <BR> Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
4129,I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is. <BR> The dangerous man Caesar is the man who doesn't care.
4130,"I guess we all did.  You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you... <BR> Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain."
4131,Alors? <BR> Alors quoi? <BR> Le montage lemballage. Not your regular street muck is it? This is collectors stuff. How much would it cost me? <BR> A lachat trois ou quatre mille. En location cinq cent. Mais ça pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. Cest pas vraiment mon truc.  I dont know any Austrian Xavier. <BR> But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian in London dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known reachable. <BR> Then why dont you reach him? <BR> I dont have your credentials Nathalie.
4132,You gotta be fucking crazy!  You got stabbed in the ass once too much sweetheart cause you're gonna end up in Section 13 that's what - not the 'catacombs. <BR> Section 13?
4133,It's for you. <BR> For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag? <BR> Open it. <BR> What is this some kind of joke? <BR> No it's five thousand dollars. <BR> Shit. I don't want your money you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway. <BR> What do you care where it comes from? It's yours. <BR> And why the hell would you give me money? <BR> So I can get my job back. <BR> Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for? <BR> To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want and it doesn't cost me a cent. <BR> You're a dumb whacked-out little fuck do you know that?
4134,Yeah Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years he always made money with them. <BR> Hey Rich.
4135,What for? <BR> To warn him. <BR> Of what? <BR> That Dillinger's on to him.
4136,I had to get in to meet Margo! I had to say something be somebody make her like me! <BR> She did like you she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away! <BR> That's not true! <BR> I was there I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door!
4137,I guessed you were straight black. <BR> Good guess.
4138,Wow...you clean up nice. <BR> Put your eyeballs back in your head William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
4139,Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war. <BR> Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care? <BR> There won't be any way to stay out of it.
4140,I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this. <BR> It's okay--I don't mind.
4141,"Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was? <BR> What about it? <BR> Any idea where it is? <BR>  <BR> I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing but... what else do you know? <BR> I know plenty."
4142,The business is changing Rat. I'll tell you these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith. <BR> I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now. <BR> There used to be three or four of those guys. Now we see 'em every time we come to the mall.
4143,Don't worry. It's a test. <BR> It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
4144,If you're not at my place by 7.00 Tom and I are running off together. <BR> Okay.
4145,Alvy I... <BR> What-what-what-what's the matter? <BR> I-you know I don't wanna. <BR> What-what-I don't... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know it's been a long time. <BR> I know well it's just that- you know I mean I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night so I have to rest my voice. <BR> It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records. <BR> I know. Well Alvy it'll pass it'll pass it's just that I'm going through a phase that's all. <BR> M'm. <BR> I mean you've been married before you know how things can get. You were very hot for Allison at first.
4146,Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist.  People might like to see the face behind the makeup. <BR> ... Behind the makeup?
4147,Why do they keep calling you George? <BR> I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
4148,I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma. <BR> A what? <BR> I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there? <BR> I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.
4149,You all take care of yourself too Homer! <BR> We see you next harvest.
4150,Jeanne calm down do you hear me? Are you alright? <BR> Yes... <BR> It's over Jeanne.  We won just as you said!
4151,Wow. That shirt is working hard. <BR> Is Vanessa here? <BR> Nope. We're safe.
4152,You promise not to say anything? <BR> On my mother's life. <BR> Okay...
4153,"We don't think so. I mean we just want the singing when I come out. <BR> Okay great. What will that be? <BR> We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic. <BR> What song? <BR> You Send Me."""""" <BR> Oh I know that. How does it go... <BR> You know,  Darling you...you send me...Darling you ...You mend me.  Honey, sing it for Judge Tower."
4154,I just have a hard time with insipid sexist violence. <BR> We can still Sandra Bullock it. <BR> Sandra started without us. We can stay. He kisses her again then breaks away.
4155,Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident? <BR> Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay I assume. <BR> Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything? <BR> You mean Twombley? <BR> Yes Wade I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
4156,What the hell can I do? <BR> What you've already decided. You're not really asking. <BR> If I were? <BR> Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish huh? <BR> I don't care.  He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him the police will have to take him down. Not me I'm just looking at evidence.
4157,A wino? Jesus Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you and in your little wormy brain you're trying to figure out did she fuck someone tonight? <BR> No see Clem I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
4158,It was in Chinatown. <BR> What were you doing there? <BR> Working for the District Attorney. <BR> Doing what?
4159,You keep slipping away. How do you do that? <BR> I was one of those silent listening children. Glued to the shadows. <BR> I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am world. <BR> I hear good things about the new play. <BR> So do I. Over and over. <BR> Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously. <BR> Would you like to meet him? <BR> He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue. <BR> I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed. <BR> The fact is I have to get going. <BR> Is it true? <BR> Is what true? <BR> He wears a disguise. <BR> Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone. <BR> But you're his friend. <BR> Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
4160,Good afternoon! <BR> What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts. <BR> I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up. <BR> This is so good of you. <BR> Don't say it again. Now you're a Double Agent and we're going to string my Dad along I was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he's sending you. What do you think Marge... a little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?
4161,Sorry. Look you sue me your husband dies you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police. <BR> It wasn't much of a lie. <BR> If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence. <BR> But he wasn't killed.
4162,No!  You're playing with my mind! <BR> I'm trying to play with your body! <BR> I knew it--you're seducing me! <BR> Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty? <BR> I think you're real cute. <BR> Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious! <BR> You're exotic and mysterious and cute--that's why I better leave.
4163,I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give sometimes I take. It is mine to know which and when. <BR> Dumb riddles Merlin. I am your King.
4164,Oh God! Here yuh go! Oh good now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay. <BR> Okay it's in. It's definitely in the pot! <BR> All right. All right. All right.
4165,Oh that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester then? <BR> Yeah apparently. I'm having it on May 4. <BR> The tough part's almost over for you. I mean my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest. <BR> Yeah but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front. <BR> I think pregnancy is beautiful. <BR> Well you're lucky it's not you.
4166,Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime? <BR> I'm not much on rear window ethics. <BR> Of course they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass if they want to. <BR> Jeff -- if anybody walked in here I don't think they'd believe what they see. <BR> Huh? <BR> You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
4167,They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out. <BR> Save your strength lady.  Get goin' buddy. No campin' here. <BR> We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute-- <BR> Lissen I heard that before--
4168,Do you really think we're fooling anyone? <BR> Do you really think I care?
4169,What the hell did you do? <BR> I swear to God I didn't do anything.
4170,Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke? <BR> I have I don't know maybe a cigarette a week. <BR> A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week who smokes like that? <BR> I do. <BR> Christ I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable. <BR> It has it's moments.  Course you get cancer and die that's the down side. <BR> There is that.
4171,How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with? <BR> One. <BR> Were you protected?
4172,Father will you please explain what's going on? <BR> The Supreme Being the fifth element is here in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
4173,Respect the dead Hoss. Because when -- <BR> -- did you understand me when I said that -- <BR> -- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that. <BR> Goodbye.
4174,No. <BR> No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?  Dr. Sattler I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!
4175,Mr. Gordon did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died? <BR> Yes. I bought the house from her two years ago. <BR> Did she leave any records here? Tax or business records? Maybe a list of employees?
4176,That'd be my guess. <BR> So whoever did this might still be around.
4177,Not bad -- that's a real fast lens probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion though.... <BR> What else you got? <BR> Let's see -- you got a minute? <BR> Come on Phil don't jerk me around. <BR> Okay okay -- stand over there....
4178,to Grant) She's uh - - tenacious. <BR> You have no idea. <BR> to Ellie) You will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything?
4179,If I could accept the offer right now I would.  They took it back. <BR> I understand.  I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
4180,Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs? <BR> We never had any. What's the problem?
4181,These *credentials* are against the law! <BR> We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?
4182,And you honestly expect me to believe all this? <BR> I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay that's your business. <BR> I can't just leave. I have a life here a career -- <BR> Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
4183,Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out. <BR> Right.  What about sweating Lecktor? <BR> They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip. <BR> It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell. <BR> He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor...
4184,I think you know maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know. <BR> Well listen uh... Good luck with the joint huh?  <BR> Oh thanks Eddy.
4185,She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ... <BR> So she flies - <BR> She soars -
4186,Is this where no one stays? <BR> Yeah that's right that's it.
4187,Someone gonna get kacked boss? <BR> If I find out Buzz is comin' up short on dwarf bowling it's lights out for him and pink slips for you. Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other.
4188,I hate funny exit lines. <BR> Who was the trunk addressed to?
4189,You will stay Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do? <BR> I have nothing better to do Mr. Kringelein.
4190,Dad what the hell is going on? <BR> Just a minute John...okay?  Don't go away.
4191,Stop it don't move him! <BR> He can't breathe damn it.  I think his lung's collapsed!
4192,"Margo, as you know, i have lived in the Theater as a Trappist monk lives in his faith. I have no other world, no other life - and once in a great while I experience that moment of Revelation for which all true believers wait and pray. You were one. Jeanne Eagels another... Paula Wessely... Hayes - there are others, three or four. Eve Harrington will be among them... <BR> I take it she read well. <BR> It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire... <BR> How nice. <BR> In time she'll be what you are. <BR> A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice? <BR> Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning... <BR> How nice for Lloyd. And how nice for Eve. How nice for everybody."
4193,So -- are you travelling under R? <BR> You know what -- I am. <BR> Dickie are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him. <BR> Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him in months. No I'm alone. 
4194,Whatever I say you'll take him away won't you? <BR> I have to. <BR> You're his friend Jack. Why can't you leave him alone? <BR> Because it's his bad luck to be special. <BR> He thinks you want him to look at evidence. <BR> Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing too. He doesn't like that part of it... <BR> You wouldn't like it either if you had it.
4195,What the hell was all that about? <BR> What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others. <BR> Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation. <BR> Well we can try...
4196,Yes'm that was it. <BR> Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. Says they'll send you up again. <BR> Forget it Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean. <BR> Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes. <BR> Forget it Ma. Jus' think about the nice things out there. Think about them grapes and oranges--an' ever'body got work--
4197,Been a long time huh...? <BR> I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse? <BR> Mary Rooney. She won't talk to me. I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
4198,Who's Charles Colson? <BR>  <BR> Who's Colson Harry? <BR> The most powerful man in America is President Nixon probably you've heard his name.
4199,Here's what I think...I think these mokes below are a hit sqaud. <BR> I saw these guy perform...at Altmont ...you know that? They opened for the Stones...
4200,I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that? <BR> Yes. <BR> It was at Diane's party in Malibu and I had just broken up with Todd and I was loaded for bear any man who had the nerve to come at me -- watch out.  So you come sauntering in -- you know that saunter you do. That watch out baby here comes Mr. Smooth thing.
4201,This Jimmy's? <BR> You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine. <BR> Is that like an hereditary thing Magdelana or can one take classes? <BR> Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this? <BR> He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side wasn't he? <BR> -- Leo was an apple that's right. Red on the outside white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him. <BR> Who did? <BR> You're the FBI. That's your job isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here? <BR> A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine. <BR> Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
4202,C'mon man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo. <BR> No.  I gotta tell him the address so he doesn't go in. <BR> Go in where? <BR> The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow. <BR> I know pal.  I remember.  Twenty-nine years tomorrow.
4203,Do you know this my lady? <BR> It could only be one thing....  It's a crysknife. <BR> Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning? <BR> Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife in Chakobsa is... maker of death.  It's a maker...
4204,Alright.  But why if Kennedy is so clean in all this didn't he cancel Track 2? <BR> 
4205,How do you know about Eugene? <BR> You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me.
4206,Talk! <BR> A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar... <BR> Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar. <BR> Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches. <BR> Keep talking. <BR> Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied. <BR> And maybe you lie... <BR> In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.
4207,Well it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas and from then on I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas or even near it. <BR> What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
4208,I'm thinking of going back to school. <BR> Social work? <BR> How'd you know? <BR> Educated guess. <BR> I'm that predictable? No you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown -- <BR> You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.
4209, <BR> I think so. <BR> Are you sure? <BR> No. <BR> When will you be do you think?-- when are we going to know it all? <BR> It may never come out. <BR> Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources. <BR> Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect yes ma'am. <BR> And the underground garage one.  Would I know him? <BR> I couldn't say. <BR> But it's possible. <BR> It is. <BR> You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me. <BR> I would if you really ever wanted to know. <BR> I really want to know.
4210,I will of course do my best to hang onto it. <BR> Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he? <BR> I cant tell you that yet. But hes being well looked after. <BR> Oh no. Youll have to do better than that Mr Lombard. <BR> Look Mrs De Moraes however much of a let down it might be your brothers not back to his old weekend tricks! Impressionable as he is he probably grew tired of healthy girls in grisly poses tried moving on to bigger things came upon more than hed bargained for and somehow fancied he could take on the real world. Which he no doubt chanced upon on his way to that thing now sitting on your table... Have a look at it Mrs De Moraes. I told you I had bad news...
4211,... What is he deaf?... So uh how long have you been with the escort service? <BR> I don't know. Few munce. <BR> Ya find the work interesting do ya? <BR> ...What're you talking about?
4212,Thank you Fidel Castro. <BR> You're not going to blame this on Castro are you? <BR> I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared that's why. <BR> I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you. <BR> Buddy before you join the jubilation at my being beaten again you should remember: People vote not out of love but fear.  They don't teach that at Sunday School or at the Whittier Community Playhouse!
4213,Have you seen Hugo? <BR> No. Any idea which channel he's on?
4214,Carcharadon Carcharias. <BR> That's it. <BR> Okay so that's it. <BR> Is there one in these waters? <BR> What makes you think there might be? <BR> Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish.... <BR> This is a mammal not a fish. <BR> Jesus don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this. <BR> Probably. <BR> That's it?  Probably?  Look sharks are attracted by blood and thrashing around.... <BR> And sound. <BR> Sound? <BR> Sound.  Like sonar or radar. They home in on irregular sounds unusual sounds any rhythmic low- frequency vibration. <BR> So there's one around here. <BR> Not necessarily.  These wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea or more.  None of them are immediately fatal.  Currents could've carried the body 10 miles further.
4215,Haven't you got another pew - not so close to the band?  How about that one? <BR> Sorry sir.  That's reserved for members of the immediate family.
4216,I'm sorry I just hallucinated. <BR> Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
4217,Hiya sport.  Where'd you come from huh? <BR> Can we keep him?
4218,...WB2YXB calling unidentified station Queens.  CQ 15. <BR> Hello? <BR> I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it? <BR> Huh? <BR> The World Series.  You called Buford's homer. <BR> Wasn't too tough buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago. <BR> What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon. <BR> This afternoon?
4219,I didn't sleep well. <BR> Do you want to talk about it? <BR> I need a shower.
4220,Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too? <BR> Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
4221,Oh Peter! What happened? Are you all right? <BR> Come onget in. <BR> Oh you've been hurt! There's a cut on <BR> Come on! come on!  <BR> What happened? <BR> Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket!  <BR> What'd you give him for the car? <BR> A black eye. 
4222,Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now and don't do anything I wouldn't do. <BR> I wouldn't think of it.  See you around fellas.
4223,Where's Mike today? <BR> Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th. <BR> What's April 16th? <BR> It's John Bonham's birthday. <BR> John Bonham? <BR> John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday. <BR> Oh. I see.
4224,It is something really important Jeff? <BR> I'm afraid it is Tess. <BR> I'll have him call the moment I hear from him. <BR> Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight. <BR> Who's Thorwald? <BR> He knows.  Don't worry Tess. It's a man. <BR> Goodnight you idiot. <BR> Goodnight Mrs Doyle.
4225,I must be destroyed. <BR> Can you get us in there past security?
4226,I looked everywhere honey but all I could find was your hat. <BR> But what if we leave them behind? <BR> Oh don't worry honey I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.
4227,Something I don't already know? <BR> Well it's just kind of a coincidence isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming both started in '83 both in area six...both in Vice?
4228,No Marge doesn't know the half of it. <BR> I think it might hurt her to know. <BR> And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore. <BR> I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you. <BR> Well if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away? You've been a great friend to my son. Everything is someone else's fault. We all want to sow wild oars. Somebody's got to -- what's the word?  The moment someone confronts him he lashes out. He lashes out. You know people always say you can't choose your parents but you can't choose your children.
4229,Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true? <BR> Not all of them... I know which ones will. <BR> Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach. <BR> What is it? <BR> The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot. <BR> Where? <BR> Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug? <BR> I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried... <BR> Did they try and fail? <BR> They tried and died....  Jessica!
4230,I'm in a wheelchair the truck sounds pretty good. <BR> Amazing you made it this far.
4231,How observant you are. As a matter of fact I wanted to give you a word of advice. <BR> Yeah? Have a brandy? <BR> Thank you. Rick there are many exit visas sold in this cafe but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open. <BR> I thought it was because we let you win at roulette. <BR> That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa. <BR> Yeah? What's his name? <BR> Victor Laszlo. <BR> Victor Laszlo?
4232,I'm not screwing around with you man...I hate the cold water. <BR> What is it man? <BR> I'm looking...
4233,"I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go. <BR> 'HE'?  Whom do you mean-"
4234,Rick there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe. <BR> What again? <BR> This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer no less.
4235,There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion. <BR> We've got to get an abortion? <BR> Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once. <BR> It's already planned Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic. <BR> Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it? <BR> Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic. <BR> Seventy-five dollars and a ride. Okay.
4236,Dad we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too! <BR> Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
4237,... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before. <BR> Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
4238,... Why the mask? <BR> Alicia!  Come here have a seat.  Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
4239,You like jazz! <BR> I love jazz. <BR> This is the best. Marge says she likes jazz but she things Glenn Miller is jazz.
4240,I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer... <BR> I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there. <BR> I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out. <BR> How? <BR> Because...because you came out and said something you couldn't have possibly have known. You came back and repeated three names...
4241,I'm sorry. <BR> I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
4242,That thing's got a what twenty-five twenty-seven foot neck? <BR> The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
4243,You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something brother  when you're climbing up the ladder of success don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit. <BR> I'll make you another one. <BR> Forget it.
4244,Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you? <BR> There is no reason to assume other people were involved. <BR> Your clients were arrested with a walkie-talkie; they didn't need that to talk among themselves.
4245,No I've never seen them. <BR> You're sure of that. <BR> Yes. <BR> That wasn't a question.
4246,Now don't take this the wrong way but you are a terminator right? <BR> Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems Model 101. <BR> No way!
4247,-- no -- Marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that -- <BR> -- please -- Jason -- omigod -- <BR> -- quiet -- <u>quiet</u> --
4248,Don't mind him Finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone. <BR> I don't mind him...but I do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup.
4249,Okay okay just don't everyone talk at once...First of all little Jason has a learning disability... <BR> Yeah his lack of intelligence. Sorry Wendy but as learning disabilities go stupidity is often overlooked.
4250,We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us. <BR> But that's an hour's drive. <BR> Lobster Fra Diavolo. Spaghetti with red clam sauce. Antipasto. And pastry that'll make you wanna go home and slap your sweet mama.
4251,That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know! <BR> She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
4252,Roselli?  Johnny Roselli? <BR> Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba. <BR> I never met the man. <BR> I know you've been very careful not to.  That's why I'm concerned.
4253,The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples and get a match to a certain beach we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this? <BR> No.  But let's do it anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
4254,Marge? Where are you going? <BR> I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra. <BR> The scent you're wearing. I bought it for you not Dickie. The thing about Dickie. So many things. The day he was late back from Rome -- I tried to tell you this -- he was with another girl. I'm not talking about Meredith another girl we met in a bar. He couldn't be faithful for five minutes. So when he makes a promise it doesn't mean what it means when you make a promise. Or I do. He has so many realities Dickie and he believes them all. He lies. He lies that's his... half the time he doesn't even realize.
4255,Are you all right? <BR> I've been better -- <BR> How long have we been driving? <BR> I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
4256,Of course but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed -- <BR> Oh shut up Alex.
4257,It makes us feel a whole lot better. <BR> That's what I thought he said.
4258,Evil days -- I've shown you here --  -- my company exports to the Balkans alone sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year. <BR> Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different! <BR> What?
4259,Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me Sallie. Then you. <BR> The name's Charlie.
4260,"I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this.  Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me. <BR> John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, On the road of the informer it's always night.""""  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country John.  It's the presidency."" <BR> I understand that, sir. <BR> Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you."
4261,Rolfe. <BR> Wade? <BR> Yeah brother look I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley Evan Twombley? <BR> There was something. It happened up your way. <BR> Yeah I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend. <BR> Wade it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits. <BR> No not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
4262,Don't want to talk todon't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody. <BR> But it's King Westley on the phone. <BR> Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did Westley not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory isn't it? Yeah. Well it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows. <BR> There's another wire from Peter sir. They're in Glen Falls Michigan. <BR> 
4263,Well I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick have you got these letters of transit? <BR> Louis are you pro-Vichy or Free French? <BR> Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed. <BR> Well it looks like you're a little late. <BR> Huh?
4264,We're family Caesar. <BR> No! <BR> Gimme the gun. <BR> I can't.  I can't. <BR> Give it to me.
4265,What time is it? <BR> Later. Go back to sleep. <BR> Where you going? <BR> I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt. <BR> Now?!  It's after eleven. <BR> I can't sleep. <BR> Again? Maybe you should see a doctor. <BR> I'm not sick Richard. I'm just not tired now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
4266,Down to Miami and back--how much damage can I do? <BR> You're the fella who forgot he rented a Hertz car do I have to tell you they didn't forget to send us the bill?
4267,You're breaking my ribs! <BR> What? <BR> You're breaking my ribs!
4268,Don't worry I'll get some more. <BR> There's no time. <BR> Don't be silly Caesar.  It'll take five minutes.
4269,Of course he's been very involved in his music hasn't he? I think his theory is you know you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly. <BR> Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't. <BR> How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink? <BR> No thanks.  Some kid at the American Express Office.  Are you living here?
4270,If you really want to help me there's one thing you can do. <BR> Tell me... <BR> Tell the king to give me more men.
4271,Look Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay? <BR> I would if I knew where I was taking him. <BR> Hannah are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives? <BR> Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it. <BR> That strikes me as odd. <BR> James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once but...  Come to think of it it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember.
4272,What's going on? <BR> What's it look like?  We're going in. <BR> Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know -- <BR> -- all we know?  We don't know shit Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio! <BR> What about the body that fell out of the window -- ? <BR> Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement!
4273,Water. Worth killing for out here I'd think. <BR> Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars. <BR> I already did.
4274,Jesus you scared me. What are you doing here? <BR> I live here. <BR> I thought you were going to the mixer? <BR> I had to change. Did anyone call? <BR> Just some asshole trying to scare me.
4275,What? <BR> Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell. <BR> That'll solve all our problems.
4276,It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours. <BR> I don't care if I never get home.
4277,When? <BR> October 22 1969. <BR> Jesus Christ...that's...ten days from now.  How?
4278,Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really. <BR> W-why are you telling me all this Mr Lombard?
4279,But outside it's living human tissue.  Flesh skin hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs. <BR> Look Reese I know you want to help but... <BR> Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat bad breath everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him. <BR> Hey I'm not stupid y'know. They can't build anything like that yet. <BR> No.  Not yet.  Not for about forty years.
4280,Where'd you get this ball? <BR> It's mine. <BR> Who gave it to you? <BR> Grace Skinner. <BR> Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you? <BR> She's my mom.
4281,Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch? <BR> He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property you know that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache? <BR> It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting. <BR> You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!
4282,Why? <BR> You go in for dangerous things. <BR> Darned if I don't! 
4283,"That's very kind of you. <BR> The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat --"
4284,"He was creepy. <BR> Yeah I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along. <BR> Oh really? Well la-de-da! <BR> La-de-da.

That you really like those New York girls. <BR> Well, no... not just, not only. <BR> Oh, I'd say so. You married-"
4285,The owl told him about Leo. That's incredible. I guess we just broke the back of this investigation didn't we? Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court? <BR>  <BR> Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster. <BR> Go back to your DNA finger-printin'.
4286,But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved. <BR> Got a lot of holes in the desert and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? Before you know it you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all fuckin' night.
4287,You a mini-golfer? <BR> Nope. <BR> Paradise huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave. <BR> Can I get you something for the road? <BR> You have orange whips? <BR> Orange who? Not from 'round here are ya? <BR> No. I'm from Akron.

Well if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on...  <BR> You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through. <BR> Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head. <BR> What you need is some relaxation. <BR> Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink.

4299,It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police... <BR> We can do all of that later but first you need to calm down.

Can I treat you to a hamburger? <BR> Uh ... actually it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished okay? <BR> Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long. <BR> Forty-one pages.
4310,Sir your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy for a length of road you can ride around. <BR> So be it to the death. <BR> It is you sir who knows not the virtue of humility as a true king must.
4311,Your lines are in the script but you can ad lib. <BR> Ad lib? <BR> In fact I want you to ad lib that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show.
4312,I don't know I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here? <BR> Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
4313,Right?  Buddy? <BR> I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet. <BR> Oh.  Oh that's good. <BR> But we're not on my planet are we? <BR> No.

What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy you got me into... <BR> Look Dixon calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment. <BR> What if he asks where I got the money? <BR> Tell 'em your father gave it to you. <BR> What if they call him? <BR> They won't. That's not their jurisdiction. <BR> You sure? <BR> Yes! Read the Constitution it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything nothing. <BR> I don't know anything! <BR> Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.

4323,Fust thing I'll get is coffee cause ever'body been wantin' that an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy.

4324,Where were you going? <BR> I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy...

4335,Well nobody can say we didn't try. <BR> Okay here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome we could narrow it down and-- <BR> And then what Faith? <BR> And then... we rent a truck or a car either one and we set up a loudspeaker and we drive through the surrounding areas and we page him.

4338,This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested? <BR> I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
4339,We've got to keep moving. <BR> Where are we? <BR> You got me. But I think I know what they did with Jimmy Hoffa.

4343,Who are you? <BR> He's the owner... <BR> Why don't you want a message sent?
4344,We keep in radio contact. <BR> You've been listening in the whole time? <BR> You think I'd let him run loose without a chaperone? Blade ferrets their rat-holes out I map them. Then we blow them all to kingdom come.
4345,Listen very carefully I'm telling the truth... this is the game.  This was all the game. <BR> Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold Fisher whoever... they shot him... <BR> No now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ? <BR> I saw them kill him! <BR> What did you <u>really see</u>?

You can't put a Mountie hat in your...
4349,Take your  fuckin' bag and get out of here! <BR> I'll go but I want my money right now!
4350,You're thinking: okay there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up right ... ? <BR> Something like that -
4351,We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant. <BR> He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment. <BR> All right Bruce what do you suggest? <BR> I suggest a nice big bomb. <BR> Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws. <BR> Then for God's sake Harvey cancel the anniversary celebration. <BR> We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by -- <BR> Do you still think the Joker cares about money?? <BR> I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I don't have access to all you expert sources.

4356,There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom. <BR> I can handle the exterior alarm but the one in the bedroom is a problem.

Not feel so guilty all the time. <BR> We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours watch some TV take a bath. <BR> Don't be a cop. If you have any doubts about this it's my fault.
4360,No sexual confusion there eh Professor? <BR> Shut up and drink.
4361,I don't know if I'd go that far. <BR> It's true It's true!  Least it used to be true.

I told you 'Kenny that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go. <BR> Well I got to Nashville. That's pretty far. <BR> Next you'll be sick. <BR> I feel really good. <BR> How are you going to pay when you get sick? <BR> I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green. <BR> Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather <BR> I don't know his first name. <BR> Bet the sheets are grey. <BR> No. No they're white. He's got a nice dog. <BR> Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus. <BR> Fungus? <BR> He doesn1t have fungus does he? <BR> I don't think so. <BR> Well you'll get it skin as sensitive as yours. <BR> How do you know if they do?
4386,I need a minute here okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches? <BR> Anything it samples by physical contact.
4387,And what's the occasion of this celebration? <BR> It's my birthday. <BR> And how many people will be attending this birthday party? <BR> I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  The guest list is quite restricted. So far there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept that would make three of us. <BR> Ah-hah I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go-- <BR> Three's a crowd. Yes I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble. <BR> And what are you his chaperone? <BR> Actually I'm his father.
4388,And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive. <BR> Sensitive -- what is that? <BR> Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking. <BR> So what makes you so sensitive? <BR> Well for one I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people. <BR> What do you read? What's the last book you read? <BR> Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough. <BR> Yeah well I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too. <BR> It's a way Damone. It's a vibe. I put it out and I have personally found that girls do respond.
4389,And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies? <BR> They live in Malaysia. In this country they'd have to be specially raised from imported eggs. <BR> Dr. Lecter...
4390,"That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater! <BR> Let's just cut him open and see what's inside..."
4391,He was my Grandfather too. <BR> I meant biologically. <BR> That's a crappy thing to say. <BR> Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
4392,That was uncalled-for. <BR> I'm sorry Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink? <BR> Thank you no. I have some work to do... assuming I can still log on.
4393,Is the baby okay? <BR> Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
4394,-- who? -- who else is here? -- <BR> -- no! -- not me! -- no other people! -- <BR> -- shut up! -- just shut the --
4395,"But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to. <BR> He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill? <BR> He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun. <BR> But if he knew we have so little time - <BR> If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all. <BR> I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal. <BR> What would it take? <BR> Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that? <BR> State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place? <BR> You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself? <BR> She doesn't know what we're up to. And we can't afford to let her find out."
4396,So what is it you want to know? <BR> I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created. <BR> Created? <BR> Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you. <BR> Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai. <BR> You seem one to me. <BR> A Samurai has honor a Samurai live by the code of Bushido the way of the warrior.  I'm just a killer for hire.  The world isn't about honor anymore. It's about survival.
4397,Dog eat dog Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last. <BR> That's a great philosophy. <BR> You 'Merican.  You don't know.
4398,It's all right Mickey. <BR> You ruined my life Mister... Me and my wife... and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl. We been going four years.  Four years... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they what what they did to her sister. <BR> I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case... <BR> What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman I'm trying to get my wife out of town we hired you we're paying you I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred... <BR> I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case a famous doctor as an expert witness and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars. <BR> You guys you guys you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital you... it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
4399,What am I to do with the packages if... <BR> Burn the passport and keep the money. Think of it as a donation to the cause...
4400,I could fight you on this. <BR> You could.  But if I leave without your signature this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink options narrow compensations shrivel.
4401,Going somewhere? <BR> China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
4402,Good evening Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron? <BR> I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous -- <BR> Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed you look so nice. <BR> Oh thank you Miss Flaemm. Oh please Miss Flaemm -- Permit me Miss Flaemm won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip. <BR> No - absinthe. <BR> Yes -- that --
4403,Sorry Preysing.  <BR> You've decided against the merger? <BR> Yes -- <BR> Then it's all over? <BR> Yes --
4404, <BR> The bathroom. <BR> I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall. <BR> Thank you Mr. Bates. <BR> Norman Bates.
4405,Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office Irwin? <BR> 'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged. <BR> So tell me about the Times article. <BR> What do you want to know? <BR> No games Irwin; give. <BR> My big civil rights buddy--  --boy if John Mitchell was after your phone records would you be screaming.  What're you onto? <BR> Something maybe big. <BR> And that makes anything you do OK is that it? <BR> Just tell me about the goddamn article. <BR> It was accurate but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed. <BR> Who by? <BR> A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis.  <BR> Irwin? I really feel bad doing something like this--you know that don't you?
4406,Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean that's where I normally find things. <BR> He seemed like a nice guy Alex.
4407,Will you leave me alone already...? No Sean it's over... I don't care... As a matter of fact I am... Yeah. In his hotel room... <BR> Holy shit. <BR> I'm having fun Sean. Can you handle that...? Yeah. He doesn't judge me.
4408,How about noise? Can you get noise? We don't need speed just noise right? <BR> Right...
4409,--I'm sure-- <BR> --I'm not sure it still feels thin-- 
4410,What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it. <BR> The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.
4411,Well what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway. <BR> The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--
4412,Finnegan what the hell was that? <BR> I don't know...you got what we need? <BR> If I don't I ain't going back to get it...you think we're safe?
4413,I didn't know him Sir. He passed away when I was six. <BR> Seven.
4414,What's going on? <BR> Lynch is giving him the boot... He's not pulling his quota.
4415,That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own. <BR> He's better though right? <BR> He's better. <BR> Look I'm sorry but it's important to me. I mean a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again just once more-- you know what I mean?
4416,Were you with him this whole time? <BR> Oh God! You scared me! Yes... <BR> You still in love?
4417,"What is it? <BR> A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours. <BR> You're lying. <BR> No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet. <BR> A virus? <BR> A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks. <BR> This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease? <BR> No! For God sake you've got it all backwards."
4418, <BR> You and Wichita go to school together right?  Have you two ever... <BR> That would be a No. <BR> That wants to be a Yes.
4419,I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain... <BR> --It must wait child. These good ladies for whom I intervened once will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
4420,Kill the people.  Got your key? <BR> See you home...
4421,I also need someone who can read and write. <BR> This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it. <BR> I thought you were an archer? <BR> Yes I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to? <BR> The King of England.  I want to give them the chance to leave Orleans in peace before I get there.
4422,But how can it change every time? <BR> It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible.
4423,Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it? <BR> I don't have it.
4424,Okay. I think everything's set.  You've got the number for Cape Cod right? Just in case something goes wrong. <BR> No problem Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep. <BR> How long you been working for me Auggie? <BR> I don't know. Thirteen fourteen years. Something like that. <BR> It's pretty crazy don't you think? I mean a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for? <BR> I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much boss. <BR> Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know settled down somewhere with a kid or two a nice steady job. <BR> I almost got married once. <BR> Yeah I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh. <BR> Ruby McNutt. My one true love. <BR> Sounds like another one of your stories to me. <BR> She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge though she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel. <BR> Lovely. <BR> She made a play for me after I got back but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch I'd start thinking about that hole in her head that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape. <BR> You don't take anything seriously do you? <BR> I try not to anyway. It's better for your health. I mean look at you Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks and I'm still waiting for my first. <BR> I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day. <BR> Enjoy it while you can Vin. Pretty soon they're going to legislate us out of business anyway. <BR> They catch you smoking tobacco they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you. <BR> Tobacco today sex tomorrow. In three or four years it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers. <BR> Speaking of which are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos? <BR> It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars. <BR> No thanks. I don't care what you do but just make sure you don't get caught okay? The last I heard it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country. <BR> It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail? <BR> Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long. <BR> They come in they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail. <BR> I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September Auggie. <BR> Okay my man. Love to the wife and kids et cetera et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
4425,I was great eh? <BR> Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you. <BR> Can't you let me enjoy the moment? <BR> The moment's over.  If this guy starts me off with a breaking ball I'm going downtown--
4426,What do you think happened on this boat? <BR> I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question isn't it? <BR> The what? <BR> Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But judging by our Greek friends down below it doesn't look like the last time. <BR> Are we smart enough to avoid that? <BR> I don't know are we?
4427,No... The General is right. <BR> MOM!!! <BR> Boobie... This is the only way you're ever going to learn. I have an opportunity here to teach you about consequences.
4428,You sucked that guy's dick? <BR> Yeah. How do you think I know he liked... <BR> But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him! <BR> That's because I never had sex with him! <BR> You sucked his dick! <BR> We went out a few times. We didn't have sex but we fooled around. <BR> Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys? <BR> Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people. <BR> Oh my God-I feel so nauseous... <BR> I'm sorry Dante. I thought you understood. <BR> I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys and that's all you said. <BR> Please calm down. <BR> How many? <BR> Dante... <BR> How many dicks have you sucked?! <BR> Let it go... <BR> HOW MANY? <BR> All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked. <BR> This is different. This is important. How many?!
4429,Right. Well Juno your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home. <BR> Naah. I'm already pregnant so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
4430,I always forget to put the sign on but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins twelve vacancies. <BR> In the past two days I've been to so many motels my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large. <BR> I don't really forget the sign it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register please? <BR> Sit down. I don't want to trouble you just want to ask... <BR> No trouble. Today's linen day. I change all the beds once a week whether they've been used or not... dampness. I hate the smell of dampness.  It's such a dank smell.
4431,So he says you sent them? <BR> They're all a bunch of phonies.
4432,You should've been out there.  You should've seen him waving that gun like a maniac.  There were shots fired! <BR> He thought he had a good reason.
4433,It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard! <BR> It was an act of God for Christ's sake.
4434,Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week. <BR> Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night Alvy wanted to have sex. <BR> She would not sleep with me the other night you know it's- <BR> And... I don't know... I mean six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it just to please him. <BR> I mean... I tried everything you know I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb and... <BR> But the thing is-I mean since our discussions here I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh uh I really asserted myself. <BR> The incredible thing about it is I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed. <BR> I don't know though I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it so you know so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win. <BR> You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress. <BR> Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.
4435,"I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell? <BR> Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours. <BR> Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter? <BR> They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention..."
4436,YO! Jean this is Ramellzee. <BR> Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here don't you? <BR> Uh-oh! <BR> I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
4437,How much money did you leave up there? <BR> Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning. <BR> You're trusting. <BR> Why do you say that? <BR> How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take? <BR> Theoretically people see money on the counter and nobody around they think they're being watched. <BR> Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish? <BR> I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off. <BR> Do you think anyone can see us down here? <BR> Why? You wanna have sex or something? <BR> Ooh! Can we?! <BR> Really? <BR> I was kidding. <BR> Yeah right. You can't get enough of me. <BR> Typically male point of view. <BR> How do you figure? <BR> You show some bedroom proficiency and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you? <BR> Women? Women as lovers are all basically the same: they just have to be there. <BR>  <BR> Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat. <BR> How flattering. <BR> Now making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge. <BR> Oh you think so? <BR> A girl makes a guy cum it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum it's talent. <BR> And I actually date you? <BR> Something wrong? <BR>  <BR> I touched a nerve. <BR> I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life. <BR> It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization. <BR>  <BR> These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me. <BR> How many? <BR> How many what? <BR> How many girls have you slept with? <BR> How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once? <BR> We might have; I don't remember. How many? <BR> Including you? <BR> It better be up to and including me. <BR> Twelve. <BR> You've slept with twelve different girls? <BR> Including you; yes.
4438,I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone okay? <BR> Sure thing. See you later.
4439,What do you do with the jackets people leave here? <BR> We keep them. <BR> You keep them. <BR> We keep them in case the people come back.
4440,God I miss you. I don't know what to do without you. <BR> Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
4441,What kind of problems? <BR> Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light -- <BR> Amnesia? <BR> Before this? Before Bourne? No.
4442,You know how happy I'd be if that was really true Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time! <BR> Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men? <BR> You know everything you do gets me hot.
4443,Just in town on business. Just in and out. Ha ha! A little of the old in-and-out! <BR> Wuddya do?  Carl looks around. <BR> Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other uh clients? <BR> I don't think so. It's nice. <BR> Yeah well it depends on the artist. You know Jose Feliciano ya got no complaints. Waiter!
4444,When worlds collide. <BR> Huh? <BR> 4:30 movie. When Worlds Collide.
4445,Frank we need to talk... <BR> John hold on a second.  I'm in the middle of something important here.  You mind if...
4446,Can't we -- <BR> Too many people. Come on!  SHIELDS!!
4447,Things are kind of confusing. <BR> I'll back that up. <BR> Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this. <BR> I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times but nothing about undead. <BR> It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling. <BR> No you're not.
4448,Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude. <BR> You are? <BR> Yeah. The other day some sort of Chinese bitch told me I'd look good with muscles.
4449,This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied doesn't it Mr. Richard? <BR> You said it!  Here's looking at you kid.
4450,Is she with you? <BR> Who is this? <BR> Sebastian you faggot. Is she with you? <BR> No. <BR> Where is she?! <BR> I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone. <BR> McConnell I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is. <BR> I told you I don't know. <BR> One. <BR> Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central. <BR> Grand Central. You better not be fucking with me cause it's your ass on the line.
4451,No. I guess you're here for the backpack. <BR> Oh... yeah.
4452,Oh there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's. <BR> I have already heard about this cafe and also about Mr. Rick himself.
4453,There isn't another like you there couldn't be- <BR> But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean looking like this. <BR> You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name? <BR> Eve. Eve Harrington.
4454,It's been bad lately but it's always bad. <BR> How long you been doing this? <BR> Five years. <BR> Wow you musta seen some things huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen? <BR> You learn to sort of block it out you know like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow. <BR> You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times. <BR> I think I'd remember that. <BR> Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this? <BR> Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest. <BR> I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better you know when we're done with all this. <BR> Sure.
4455,Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last. <BR> Not likely.
4456,Mr. Abraham... <BR> Abrams... <BR> Abrams. Yes. How are you today? <BR> I'm fine. <BR> Good.  You ever been inside a hospital? <BR> Yes. <BR> Ah. How did they treat you?
4457,Who the hell do you think you are?! <BR> Excuse me. <BR> I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child. <BR> Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something. <BR> Is that so?
4458,There you are Ted-baby. Everything all right? <BR> Yeah.  Everything's cool.
4459,No don't tell me  you just got fired by your crazy boss. <BR> I guess you did. <BR> Guess I just got sick of him. <BR> Can I walk you home? <BR> I think I could do that alone.
4460,I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder. <BR> So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled he's smartened up enough to control himself? <BR> Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy Satch. <BR> Uh huh. <BR> What? <BR> I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy or you making him absolutely the guy.
4461,Okay he's just a Wilbur then. <BR> We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so have we? We used to have *dozens*!
4462,You can't kill me yet. <BR> Why? <BR> I could be lying.
4463,Who are you? Who sent you here? <BR> I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.
4464,Dad...I'm... <BR> ...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right? <BR> Yeah. How's Mom? <BR> Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you but... <BR> No don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie? <BR> Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil the lawyer you wanted...
4465,We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy! <BR> Boat or no boat...I'm going...
4466,I wish you a very good evening Mr. Preysing. You are staying here too Mr. Preysing? <BR> I don't know you. <BR> Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper building C room twenty-three -- third floor.
4467,I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency.  But I would never never consider ...  His death was awful an awful thing for this country.  Do you ever think of death Mr. Helms? <BR> Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers? <BR> No.  They make me sick.  They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young.  But let me tell you there are worse things than death.  There is such a thing as evil. <BR>  <BR> No. <BR> 
4468,When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne did you have a horse? <BR> Yes... a half-steed... white. <BR> Who gave you that horse? <BR> My king. <BR> How many did he give you? <BR> Five steeds and a few hackneys... <BR> As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses? <BR> No. <BR> What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they? <BR> Yes I was given a few but I never had time to wear them... <BR> Still pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say? <BR> And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God wouldn't you say?
4469,Excuse me? <BR> Get out <BR> You are throwing me out. <BR> Get out.
4470,I am alone and betrayed. By my wife by my beloved friend by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy you toss me aside a babbling lecher trotting after my sister... <BR> That is my destiny. I have a destiny too... <BR> With all your powers you are content to be ridiculed laughed at... <BR> My powers fade Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness I join in the making of it so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself. <BR> Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight. <BR> You betray the boy who drew the sword the boy who saw the Dragon... the Dragon who moves close by coiling and uncoiling restless looking down waiting for the King to be a king...
4471,You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls. <BR> 
4472,"I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed. <BR> About the conspiracy? <BR> I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use. <BR> I want to know where Scully is."
4473,Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought with medication they might get... <BR> Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer? <BR> It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be... <BR> So what you guinea pig sick people to find out? <BR> The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove. <BR> No we were patients.
4474,Yeah Billy Sherbert please. Put him on. <BR> Who's this? <BR> Yeah Bill listen I'll explain to you later. Just - You - You got a gun at home? Yeah. Bring it over here right away.
4475,Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador? <BR> No. In Hampstead... Why? <BR> Dont jump any red lights.
4476,This is Zero. <BR> Hi. I'm one and this is two three four and five.
4477,Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers. <BR> I should be going. <BR> What?  How about a drink? <BR> My brushes I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks though. <BR> Another time. <BR> Sure.
4478,You don't think so huh? <BR> Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
4479,Nobody's trading with anybody! Look this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be Mr. Pink? <BR> Jesus Christ Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink let's move on.
4480,And what did she die of exactly? <BR> She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart. <BR> Oh sure!
4481,It's the next level the next dimension...  ...the small ball. <BR> The small ball. <BR> It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan. <BR> Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies. <BR> If the Japanese are pansies then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner. <BR> Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
4482,It's not you it's me. I'm completely fucked up. <BR> What are you saying? <BR> Why aren't you understanding? <BR> I love you. <BR> I know. I wish I felt the same. Unfortunately I feel nothing. I think it was just the conquest. Sorry I'm completely fucked up.
4483,Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private!  <BR> A ragione. A ragione.  <BR> Hmm. C'e questa... 
4484,You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave? <BR> I don't know. <BR> Ohhh...
4485,Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married! <BR> You know what I just watched? <BR> Me pulling a can off some moron's fist. <BR> Return of the Jedi. <BR> Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married. <BR> Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back. <BR> Empire. <BR> Blasphemy. <BR> Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets. <BR> There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.
4486,He wants a fifty-thousand marker. <BR> No just - just give him give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down. <BR> He's gonna come up with ten thousand just the way you wanted.
4487,Ellen Straub. <BR> It's a pleasure.  You're from the city right? <BR> Do I look like it that much? <BR> Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here.
4488,There's more! <BR> I think that's it. <BR> There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more. <BR> God I'm telling you they're out! <BR> Come on damn it. Don't get so defensive. It could be stuck in your hair you know.
4489,I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.  Had you been traveling long? <BR> About five months -- your months. <BR> You must have come a long way. <BR> About 250 million of your miles.
4490,Were you sent by Lord Dunois? <BR> Yes... they were. <BR> Good.  Where are the English? <BR> Everywhere.  Where is the food? <BR> It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot... <BR> I know... <BR> Good.  Can you bring me to him? <BR> He's on the other side of the river.
4491,What's up man. <BR> S'up. <BR> You look big man. Diesel. You been lifting? <BR> A little. <BR> You look good man. <BR> Cool. See you later. <BR> Cool.
4492,I'd love to be macho but this is a pants wetter from all angles. <BR> The door... on three.
4493,If everything hadn't happened the way it has then I wouldn't be here right now sitting in a car with you touching your face. <BR> Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long do we?
4494,Well... <BR> Don't. I know what you're going to say. <BR> No really Sara I don't think you -- <BR> You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her. <BR> I don't think I really have a choice in that. Emily left me. <BR> She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
4495,It's my brother's neck you want not mine. <BR> Yours will do!
4496,I cant believe this...  Whats coming now eh? If I dont pay all Hells gonna break loose is that it? <BR> Well Id sooner mug an old lady... <BR> You...  Jesus Christ!
4497,"I'm honored Dick that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last. <BR> My friends call me Mister President."""""" <BR> And so shall I.  Arrange some coffee, would you General Cushman?"
4498,Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance? <BR> I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
4499,It's good. <BR> God I want to go home. <BR> Hey you know you can't this in France.
4500,You okay? <BR> Where do we go from here? <BR> I don't know airport I guess. <BR> They will have our description before we can get a plane. <BR> Yeah.
4501,"All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now... <BR> Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy... <BR> If they're still alive..."
4502,So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel. <BR> Love to sir but no can do.  No spare room.  Period. <BR> David?
4503,What did I tell you? Supposing he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef?  I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me what you said to him. <BR> Me? I said... nothin'. I said I said 'No no no.' Everything he said I just kept sayin' no. <BR> I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said 'Ginger this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death. <BR> If it's so fuckin' dangerous then why don't you kill him? <BR> I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb- <BR> Oh well then have him killed and get it over with. <BR> Hey don't be such a fuckin' smartass will you?  I mean I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this I knew it. <BR> What about my money? <BR> How the fuck am I gonna get your fuckin' money now? You think he's gonna give you fuckin' money? Are you out of your mind?!  Look what you just did to this fuckin' guy! If you would have just kept your fuckin' mouth shut!  Ah what the fuck is the use? I should've never got invol-
4504,...Blood has been shed. <BR> What the heck d'ya mean? <BR> Three people. In Brainerd. <BR> Oh geez. <BR> That's right. And we need more money. <BR> The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in? <BR> We need more - <BR> This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal - <BR> DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP! <BR> Well I'm sorry but I just - I - <BR> Look. I'm not gonna debate you Jerry. The price is now the whole amount. We want the entire eighty thousand. <BR> Oh for Chrissakes here - <BR> Blood has been shed. We've incurred risks Jerry. I'm coming into town tomorrow. Have the money ready. <BR> Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal! <BR> IS IT JERRY?  You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal! Go ahead ask 'em! <BR> ...The heck d'ya mean? <BR> I'll see you tomorrow.
4505,We'll bear off to port and run down wind. <BR> Mr. Lawford stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick get on the jib sheet.  George John Philip Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
4506,The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness. <BR> Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
4507,See I can't do it. I came out of the desert. <BR> You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that. <BR> No no medicine!
4508,What're you gonna do with Morse Code? <BR> ...we put your Guy in a <u>sweater</u>... <BR> Yeah...? <BR> 
4509,Cards are on the table. What do you think? <BR> If you mean what you say I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people.
4510,Ruining everything that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already! <BR> Ian nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
4511,And it's deflating to find out that the only way I can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was. <BR> There's nothing wrong with you Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand. <BR> Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye Jeff. <BR>  <BR> I mean what I said.
4512,What you have to understand Mr. Nixon is that we are willing to die for what we believe in. <BR> That man up there lived in similar times.  He had chaos and civil war and hatred between the races ... Sometimes I go to the Lincoln Room at the White House and just pray.  You know the liberals act like idealism belongs to them but it's not true.  My family went Republican because Lincoln freed the slaves.  My grandmother was an abolitionist.  It was Quakers who founded Whittier my hometown to abolish slavery.  They were conservative Bible folk but they had a powerful sense of right and wrong ... Forty years ago I was looking as you are now for answers.  But you know ending the war and cleaning up the air and the cities feeding the poor -- my mother used to feed hobos stopping over at our house - none of it is going to satisfy the spiritual hunger we all have finding a meaning to this life ...
4513,Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about. <BR> Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you. <BR> I swear on my life I never said a word to her about you.
4514,Do you know him? <BR> *No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
4515,Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend? <BR> Who said so? <BR> No one. <BR> I don't have a girlfriend.
4516,So what'd ya do with it? <BR> With what? <BR> With the money. <BR> He needed some clothes. <BR> Twenty-five thousand for clothes. <BR> He wanted a watch too. <BR> Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch. <BR> Mm-hm. <BR> Mm-hm.
4517,"...this is your sweater, right? <BR> Where are you going? <BR> I have to leave now."
4518,Do you watch 'Dentonvale' Janet? <BR> I've caught it once or twice. <BR> Of course!  D.T.V.'s most popular Hospital series featuring those perennial favorites Cosmo and Nation McKinley. Neuro-specialists par excellence ...if you'll pardon my French. I recommend you send Brad to them for treatment!
4519,Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all...  but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know... <BR> ...so that's why you hate him...
4520,He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him. <BR> Does she fuck? <BR> I doubt it. Who'd want to fuck her. She probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties.
4521,I wanted to tell you my plan. <BR> So tell me. <BR> I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam. <BR> Really? To Italy? <BR> Of course. Let's say for argument's sake you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or better still I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here -- <BR> Oh God I don't think so. <BR> You see particularly with the Marge problem you can just blame me. <BR> Marge and I are getting married. <BR> How? <BR> How? <BR> Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace today you're getting married. It's absurd. <BR> I love Marge. <BR> You love me and you're not marrying me. <BR> Tom I don't love you. <BR> No no it's not a threat I've explained all of that. <BR> I'm actually a little relieved you're going to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
4522,First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car. <BR> That shit is nothin'. I remember I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
4523,I don't need to pass basic seamanship. <BR> Let me see your hands...
4524,Are you okay? <BR> I'll be fine. <BR> Well I'll leave you alone now. I just came in here to get something of mine.
4525,Follow you where? <BR> Down to my car. <BR> Why? <BR> It's a surprise.
4526,Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward OK? If you don't -- <BR> What the hey. Let's go for a drive. <BR> Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right-- <BR> Nah that wasn't in the contract.
4527,I wanna fuck Darcy. <BR> Who? <BR> Darcy. Benny's little sister. <BR> Oh. You like her? <BR> Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now. <BR> Darcy? <BR> Yeah. She's so little so pretty and innocent. <BR> Yeah. She's only 13. <BR> It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember? <BR> Yeah. <BR> She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side And I watched her. <BR> Yeah. <BR> I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt. <BR> Yeah. <BR> And after about two seconds I got the biggest hard-on.
4528,That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard! <BR> Marvin I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away. <BR> What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed! <BR> And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
4529,It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender. <BR> What do you play? <BR> I rock a Harmony. <BR> Oh. <BR> What? I'm a pawn shop rocker. <BR> Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
4530,Captain? <BR> Yeah? <BR> LAPD data center reports a breach on the system.  An outside hacker has accessed files on Detectives Fleming and Stanton...and yours too Marvosa.
4531,Well it's kind of buggy out there. <BR> Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root. <BR> You drink bug repellent? <BR> No you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.
4532,To your health Frank. <BR> Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank. <BR> If you like Frank. Here's to your fuck. cheers.
4533,Think Sloan's back?  What's wrong? <BR> Nothing--I just found out that Jeb Magruder from CREEP is a bigger bike freak than I am.  I never like it when the other guy's human...
4534,"...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat. <BR> That wasn't funny."
4535,One hunnert's the best we can do here. <BR> Oh for Christ's sake where's my goddamn checkbook. Let's get this over with.
4536,I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop... <BR> It wasn't in the cards.
4537,What?! <BR> I don't want to talk about this here. <BR> Joel We're fucking gonna talk about it!
4538,Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash. <BR> I did. <BR> What'd he say? <BR> He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again. <BR> He did? <BR> I'll be back when we lose.
4539,Whats the date? <BR> The nineteenth... How come you didnt know? <BR> Ive been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister? <BR> Er... Yes... <BR> Did he ever refer to the hostility between them? <BR> He... Apparently the hostility was all hers. Leon didnt... It hurt him. They used to be close...  Their parents were in their forties when they were born you see. And mostly away. They grew up in a Scottish mansion with old nannies and servants. He... Our world was so old and cold we shone for one another Leon used to say. His sister cut him off after she got married. He never understood why but thought it was because she had no children. Was bitter...
4540,What? Deep down inside? <BR> Start with the name you were born with and we'll work forward from there. <BR> I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen Executive V.P. of -- <BR> I don't think so... <BR> Why not? <BR> Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close. <BR> There's always exceptions. <BR> Not in the movie biz. So c'mon gimme the truth.
4541,Just a boid in a gilded cage - <BR> A what? <BR> You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage. <BR> Aw you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat we're gonna forget all about this social stuff and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that? <BR> And live on your salary I suppose? <BR> Yeah live on my salary - that is until I finish writing my play. <BR> What play? <BR> My play. <BR> The one about the Siberian bloodhound? <BR> Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now. <BR> Araby? <BR> Sure. <BR> Araby my eye!
4542,Mrs. Mulwray you don't want to run around like that. <BR> Oh Christ. Escobar you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later. <BR> Mrs. Mulwray it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony. <BR> Let her go. She didn't kill anybody. <BR> I'm sorry Mrs. Mulwray. <BR> Lou she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know. <BR> Gittes stay outta this.
4543,Does that help? <BR> Yeah that looks better. Thanks.
4544,My captains have sworn their support. <BR> No doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause -- but what about the ordinary soldier?  They don't fight for causes these days. They fight for money.  Who's going to pay them?
4545,Rick that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed. <BR> Well he's succeeded in impressing half the world. <BR> It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca. <BR> It'll be interesting to see how he manages. <BR> Manages what? <BR> His escape. <BR> Oh but I just told you. -- <BR> -- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe. <BR> This is the end of the chase. <BR> Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
4546,Hi I'm Dick Nixon. <BR> You're shittin' me. <BR> Where you from? <BR> Syracuse. <BR> The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ... <BR> Ernie Davis. <BR> Right right.  I used to play a little ball myself at Whittier.  Of course they used me as a tackling dummy.
4547,Well when are you quitting? <BR> Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
4548,Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones. <BR> What the hell do you want me to do?! <BR> Stop.
4549,See you around. <BR> Where are you going? <BR> Home. <BR> How do you know that's the way?
4550,Don't get all worked up Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer. <BR> We never should have done this to him... <BR> Well what are we gonna do about it now?
4551,Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails. <BR> Really? Fingernails?
4552,Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men! <BR> Jeanne look behind you. <BR> Never look behind -- only ahead!
4553,Pigeons... It's a sign!  If Clear's right about the order then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by Pigeons! <BR> I'm not following you -- <BR> They're next on the list.  We have to find them.
4554,-- what're you doing? -- Jason please tell me what's happening! <BR> Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
4555,Wait here. I'll be right back. <BR> Where would we go?
4556,I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum -- <BR> Just do it old man.
4557,Hello Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you. <BR> Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while. <BR> Wouldn't have made a bad story would it? <BR> Great!  But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarnthen something comes alongmesses up the finishand there you are. <BR> Yeah where am I? <BR> When you sober upcome in and see me. <BR> Thanks Joe.
4558,Well this might come in handy. <BR> Thank you. <BR> Had a close one eh? <BR> Yes rather.
4559,I've worn this mask so long I couldn't sleep without it. <BR> I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either.
4560,What's the use of asking Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there. <BR> The troupe the scenery everything -- all on board waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come Madam are you mad?
4561,That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. <BR> It may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design.
4562,Now Mother your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married. <BR> I'm afraid she's right Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry Mrs. Schuyler that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.
4563,Why'd you do it Billy? <BR> For the money... ) <BR> I know you kids smoke that stuff and we drink booze but taking it across a border - it was stupid Billy. Stupid. <BR> I know.
4564,Cut to the chase William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you. <BR> In a word: MERK. EXPOSED. <BR>  <BR> There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper. <BR> You forget I dislike YOU at least as much as him. <BR> He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!
4565,We know that son. <BR> The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction. <BR> We're aware of that.
4566,Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day. <BR> It's about your parents.
4567,I don't know... I thought... <BR> YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES? <BR> I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead... <BR> WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE? <BR> I... don't know... what do you want from me? <BR> Nothing.  I'm here to set you free...
4568,He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?! <BR> Have you ever had one do this? <BR> No!
4569,Hot...  These roads all round here closed to the public... Whys that? Military bases?  Huh. I guess theres space enough for war games... Must be good for business. <BR> Must it? <BR> All those soldiers out there... getting bored thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps? <BR> Aint nobody out there Mister. <BR> Nobody? Huh!... How come? <BR> Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum... <BR> Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there though? It says closed to the public doesnt it? <BR> You a tourist?
4570,These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And well you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other. <BR> Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose? <BR> Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction.  There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.
4571,You know what I'd like? A clear empty sky... and a plane and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary you want to cut this off go out and find yourself someone available. <BR> I'm thinking of it. <BR> How can you even think a thing like that! <BR> Don't miss your plane. <BR> Hey we can leave together can't we? <BR> I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
4572,This is what we've been waiting for. <BR> What are you saying? <BR> This means they've given up trying to break the picket line.  Now we can all fight together -- all of us.
4573,I think it would be much better if you went away. <BR> We shall see who remains here the longer. <BR> As you will.
4574,Who told you that -- someone on the radio? <BR> Fuck you Philip.
4575,This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here too bro. <BR> Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
4576,So you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be? <BR> Nah it was a premeditated act. The sex I mean not getting pregnant. <BR> When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker? <BR> Like a year ago in Spanish class.
4577,Have you thought about what I said? <BR> Jesus Adam can we not get into this now please? <BR> I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack... <BR> I got you. <BR> Where's the bathroom?
4578,Oh sure we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes? <BR> It's the smoke. <BR> Joe! A little snifter.  Say wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that Gallagher. Gosh there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her. <BR> Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.
4579,Naa.. <BR> Let's get out of here. <BR> See ya in an hour.  So what do you think?
4580,"Why so nervous? <BR> I've never done this before. <BR> How have you dumped girls in the past? <BR> Screening calls. Any suggestions? <BR> I knew this guy last summer in the Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. But she had this huge weight problem. His friends taunted him mercilessly about it. You know, How do you breathe when she sits on your face?"""" """"It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her."""" Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. """"I'm completely fucked up."""" """"I'm completely fucked up."""" """"I'm completely fucked up.""""  Poor fatty never had a chance."""
4581,I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident but accept our apologies. <BR> And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage? <BR> The-Stones weren't aboard the ship. <BR> ...What do you mean?
4582,Aroused and inflamed. <BR> Alex. <BR> He even signs them in his own name can you believe it? I'd sign someone else's name. I'd sign his name. If I wrote them that is. Which I don't.
4583,Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one! <BR> I never hear the whistle. <BR> Feed the dogs.
4584,Terry!  You okay? <BR> Help!  Help! <BR> Okay okay coming....
4585,Cowards!  Twenty run from four?! <BR> The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.
4586,Are you licensed to broadcast buddy? <BR> Look I don't really remember how this thing works. <BR> Listen you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency you gotta get off the band. <BR> Pal my whole life's an emergency.
4587,Uh I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See uh maybe you didn't know it but uh Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now his family and their money go back many many years. Now friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it maybe he did not deserve to be fired. <BR> I'm sorry but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or forgive me for saying this he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way I cannot have a man like that workin' here. <BR> Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don uh we better be sure we can prove them charges. <BR> Believe me if I could prove it he would be under arrest. <BR> Are uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro? <BR> I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him. <BR> You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But he is my brother-in-law and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back. <BR> I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law and I do want to help you and I like to do favors and I know who you are but I cannot do that. <BR> Well could there be any position... further down the trough? <BR> I'm sorry I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is he cannot be trusted.
4588,Do not underestimate the power of your heart.  Your dreams live there. <BR> My dreams died long ago. <BR> Did they?  You are only a man different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live. <BR> I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows. <BR> And now it's time to come out of the shadows.
4589,I will make that recommendation to the President.  I must tell you in all honesty that I'm extremely dubious about the results. <BR> Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are. <BR> I've been dealing in Earth's politics a good deal longer than you have.  Goodnight sir.
4590,Complete your inspection? <BR> They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow. <BR> I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us. <BR> We need more time. <BR> Won't get it.  We are a sacrifice.  A diversion.
4591,Thank you your Honor. We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And your Honor having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form. <BR> ...one moment Mr. Concannon...
4592,When Arthur built the castle I carved out a place for myself where I could laugh or sleep and no one would bother me. <BR> People make you laugh?
4593,She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John! <BR> Uh. Do you like England? <BR> Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
4594,You know I've been thinking about you lately. <BR> You have? <BR> Yeah. After I saw you last week. <BR> At the block party? <BR> Yeah.
4595,What's the matter Grampa? <BR> Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin' that's all.
4596,Inaugural Speech press corp's gonna be jealous of giving up that one... <BR> Hey lemme close out the thing in style. <BR> I've come to feel It's my thing.  You know you take a job... You take a job and many times it's <u>just</u> a job.  And then... <BR> Hell of a Ride Stanley... <BR> ...<u>isn't</u> it?  Hey what-the-hey ... it's all part of the bittersweet...
4597,So how does it feel to be kissed by two women? <BR> They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones? <BR> Me and the muse of course.  How is your book coming along?
4598,Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body. <BR> Into what?
4599,How ya doing? <BR> Fine. <BR> Good. <BR> Look I appreciate you know the concern and all but like he said I can take care of myself. <BR> I just brought you something to eat.
4600,Where are you going? <BR> I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car. <BR> Can I come with you? <BR> I did your dirty work for you Sheila now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression then turns on her heel.
4601,We've been through this. <BR> If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle. <BR> Okay. All right so whatta yuh saying now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy right? <BR> Well why not? <BR> Yeah Earl Warren? <BR> Hey... honey I don't know Earl Warren. <BR> Lyndon Johnson? <BR> L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh a notch underneath child molester. <BR> Then everybody's in in the conspiracy? <BR> Tsch. <BR> The FBI and the CIA and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?
4602,Yes yes... Let's talk about that.... your roots... Your father is from Haiti isn't he? <BR> Yup. <BR> Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home? <BR> We don't hang them at home y'know  just in the streets.. <BR>  <BR> Who said that? <BR> Why that's from Time Magazine. <BR> No he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy. <BR> Is it true that your mother resides in a mental institution?
4603,I answer to Grissom punk.  Not to you. <BR> Why Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
4604,What's this guy's problem? <BR> What's my problem? Yeah I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot! <BR> What're you talkin' about? <BR> That fuckin' shooting spree in the store. <BR> Fuck 'em they set off the alarm they deserve what they got. <BR> You almost killed me asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were I never would've agreed to work with you. <BR> You gonna bark all day little doggie or are you gonna bite? <BR> What was that? I'm sorry I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it? <BR> 
4605,A prior engagement overcame me. <BR> What? <BR> Listen Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two you know good-natured encounters that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party I just did them that's all because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy. <BR> Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband -- <BR> How you take it isn't all that interesting to me Benjamin. I'm sorry -- <BR> I just can't believe you could be so --
4606,Officer I know what you're gonna say. I'm-I'm not a great driver you know I-I have some problems with- with-with- <BR> May I see your license please? <BR> Sure.  just don't-don't get angry you know what I mean? 'Cause I-I have - I have my-my license here. You know it's a rented car. And I've...
4607,But will he... ? <BR> Your daddy will always love you. <BR> How do you know? <BR> I know because... it's just something I know. <BR> I don't want to hurt my daddy. <BR> Robin listen to me.
4608,Let's break something Tom. Let's bust something bomb something. <BR> What do you want to break? <BR> I don't know--let's break some windows. <BR> Why? <BR> Destruction distraction. I feel the need. <BR> You need a reason Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy. <BR> What's the reason? Give me a reason Tom. <BR> Let me think.
4609,What are you doing? <BR> He has no heartbeat! <BR> You're hurting him!! <BR> I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once. <BR> ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!! <BR> LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS HE'S DEAD!

4614,What was prison like? <BR> You don't really -- <BR> Yes! I want to know.
4615,Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment? <BR> Well yes of course Majesty and I'm sure they are content... except that... well they are starving. <BR> Sometimes the poor do grow hungry. But why would they riot about it?
4616,Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up. <BR> Thanks.
4617,You're a fucking moron. <BR> It's my fucking opinion.
4618,We'll help with the police if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged? <BR> Yes. <BR> And they didn't take that watch?
4619,Alvy don't! You're using sex to express hostility. <BR>  <BR> There are people out there from The New Yorker magazine. My God! What would they think?
4620,Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it. <BR> Is there something I don't know about?
4621,I'm a push-over for whom?  What is it? Who's on the phone? <BR> Yes Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie!

He said he would. <BR> After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo? <BR> It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now. <BR> You talk just as Addison said you did. <BR>  <BR> I don't think anything in the world could make me say that.

I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know for taking fat cats to dinner things like that. <BR> Could buy a lot of steaks 350000 dollars. <BR> I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried. <BR> Which people? <BR> The ones who could disburse the money. <BR> Who were they? <BR> There were a group of them--I think five I don't know their names. <BR> Sloan knew which five didn't he? 
4632,So. I guess we just divorce our spouses marry each other and have this baby right? Simple. <BR> Simple.

4636,To tell you the truth I'd just about given up waiting. <BR> I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are. <BR> Mm-hmm.  Lunch.  Not even dinner.
4637, <BR> You're mocking me aren't you? <BR> Oh no no no...  Buzz look!  An alien! <BR> Where?
4638,"Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche? <BR> Keefer!..Put this man under arrest! <BR> That'll be the day...  'As we developed the village'... Next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin' men are... You won't get any headlines for killin' squaws."
4639,It's still on. <BR> What? <BR> His camera... it's still recording.
4640,I came here to have a word with your dad. <BR> What do you want with my dad? <BR> Business. <BR> Won't your father help you with that? <BR> Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be. <BR> Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.
4641,Um Clear?  I'm sorry...about before. I... <BR> Your entire world view just went out the window.  I couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight. We'll get through this.  I promise.

The light was fading and I had to get my shot. <BR> The light was fading. Huh-huh. <BR> I would love to come for dinner. <BR> Wonderful.

My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell. <BR> I guess that puts me in my place. Thank you for the hospitality Mrs. Caldwell. It was a true awakening.
4646,You've made your point. <BR> Good.  Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me. <BR> What? <BR> Evan Shaeffer's dead.  Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.

4648,Yes? <BR> Diane? <BR> Number 17. <BR> But it said #12. <BR> I switched apartments with her. She's in #17. Just walk down that way. It's just to the right.
4649,Is that Cristaile? <BR> Hm. <BR> My God I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite isn't: she? <BR> If she's not now Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening. <BR> Has he asked to see the book yet? <BR> Yes. <BR> And? Are you going to tell him? <BR> No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do. <BR> Neither do I.
4650,Well I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here. <BR> No. I want my money back right now. <BR> Well that's not the way it works really. And you ate most of your food already too... <BR> See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back.
4651,God. <BR> Remember that day? <BR> Right. Geez I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm. <BR> Thanks honey. <BR> Oh no no no no no. I mean you know no no no I mean I think it's really important for us to explore new relationships and stuff like that.
4652,It's not baby. Just a matter of minutes now before somebody pulls the trigger -- <BR> -- but nobody has yet Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger. <BR> How much more do they need than your death at his hands? <BR> But they didn't see it happen they still have doubts. What we need is another body and Steven's bloody hands right next to it! <BR> And how the hell are we going to do that? <BR> Okay: this may sound crazy but --
4653,Okay one drink. <BR> What do you want? <BR> A beer? <BR> A beer.  Of course.
4654,You're gonna be okay Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up... <BR> No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?
4655,Lava? <BR> No. <BR> What are they? <BR> I don't know.
4656,No problem Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show...  What's up? <BR> It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again. <BR> Flynn? <BR> Yes.  It felt like Flynn. <BR> He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it? <BR> I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile... <BR> Meanwhile he might find it. <BR> I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out but he's getting trickier all the time. <BR> I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe. <BR> There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right. <BR> Cute. <BR> End of line.
4657,I still feel... <BR> Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't make you feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... And the theft is what you want to do!  Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. How about that? <BR> I don't know.
4658,Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl? <BR> 
4659,I was going to fix you breakfast. <BR> You were asleep. <BR> I bought you a lot of new things.
4660,-- it's getting older by the second. Mr. Price if I could just please have -- <BR> Sorry Pritchett here you go.
4661,Good. Cos you know how it plays. Six years ago I let you go free. But the next time ... The next time sends you away for'a long long while ... <BR> By the time you get out asshole there won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin' around in space ships ...
4662,Where is Friedman? <BR> Look I dont think youre fully aware of what youre playing with here Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why dont you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner eh?
4663,And you? <BR> Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
4664,You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work. <BR> I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper. <BR> My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain. <BR> What of it? <BR> Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog? <BR> Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
4665,"Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on... <BR> Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?"
4666,It's amazing isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world. <BR> Yeah. <BR> To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh so clean so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away. <BR> You love him don't you?
4667,Hey you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us. <BR> No thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely you hear?
4668,It makes us human ... <BR> It's not fair Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it. <BR> We don't have to put ourselves through this again Dick. <BR> What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours. <BR> It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ... <BR> Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid some money at the end of the line ... You know I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure too. <BR> You're not a failure Dick. <BR> You know how much money he had in the bank when he died?  Nothing.  He was so damned honest ...  But I miss him.  I miss him a hell of a lot.
4669,I have to cut his windpipe... <BR> You're not a doctor you'll hurt him! <BR> What else should I do damn it he's dying!
4670,All right. Okay okay. <BR> Mr Rothstein why don't we just let her in the house and get a few of her things?  That way she'll get out of here. This is half her house anyway.
4671,How could this be happening? <BR> I don't know. <BR> We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time. <BR> Sun spot? <BR> Yeah that's how Hams work. <BR> Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
4672,This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else.. <BR> Do you ever get sick of it? <BR> Of what? <BR> The whole thing  painting. <BR> No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of. <BR> What about the shit they write? <BR> You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting and Andy's one of them. <BR> I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out. <BR> As long as I've known Andy he's never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs. He's painted my picture we've eaten dinner in God knows how many places together. But he doesn't care about me. He cares about you. You're the only person he cares about. He's your friend. Fuck that article. You want a toasted bagel with cream cheese?
4673,We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie! <BR> That's nice Stan.
4674,I'll never get out of here in time. <BR> The telephone calls... we know about that. <BR> The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks-- <BR> --yeah that was in The Times this morning.
4675,He's dead. <BR> If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up. <BR> He wouldn't blow up. He'd just get all mangled or twisted.
4676,But hey who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember? <BR> May be easy to remember but not easy to get. Being warm maybe -- but look you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
4677,A man helped me open it... <BR> And switched keys. <BR> He must have. <BR> It isn't another boyfriend is it?
4678,Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline turn it around and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune! <BR> I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake. <BR> Gordon I worked at Bluestar I know my way around I have friends there...inside. <BR> What does that mean? <BR> The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour that's the real hidden value G.G. if you can negotiate that out get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air... <BR> What makes you think you can? <BR> I can talk to these people Gordon they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts. <BR> Alright... Susan get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick Jensen...  So sport the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more...
4679,I like that. <BR> Whatta ya mean Boss? <BR> Ya piss like a man.
4680,Come on Pop all I want to know is one thing.  Just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it.  I bet it wasn't a big deal.  Was it Caesar? <BR> What's that Johnnie? <BR> The money I bet it was nothing to get it clean after you made such a fucking big deal ...
4681,How did you do that Flynn? <BR> Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh my head  Are we there yet Mommy? <BR> Almost... I just have to adjust our course at the next junction. I'd better go check the instruments ...
4682,That perfume you're wearing Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile would it? <BR> Why yes. How did you know? <BR> Lucky guess.
4683,It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over. <BR> Good. Come in we'll work it out. Sit down sit down.
4684,Orange whip nectar of the bowling gods. Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip.  Theo takes the other glass. <BR> Thanks.
4685,Pretty much what you'd expect. <BR> That's what I thought.
4686,Kid - didn't they tell you about this party? <BR> Tell me what? <BR> It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying? <BR> Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
4687,Jack this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints? <BR> He's working on the single print index. What time is it? <BR> Get him to Atlanta. <BR> You said the guy down here is good. <BR> He is good. Bur not as good as Price. <BR> What do you want to do? <BR> Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves Jack.  And dust all the corneas of all their eyes.
4688,Some thanks.  Enough to move on for now. <BR> You should really let a doctor look at that. <BR> Soon. <BR> But first you have something to take care of? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Something important?  A thing that cannot wait? <BR> It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them. <BR> Forgive my intrusion into your affairs but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job his agent if you will.  He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt much like the debt I suspect he owes you.
4689,Why don't you just go back to your pickin' Homer? I can take care of it myself! <BR> Rose listen--don't *do* anything. You know I mean to yourself. Please listen...
4690,Catching up on his reading.  Asked about you sends his thanks. <BR> Knock on wood. <BR> Speaking of thanks... we puttem back in what does your fellow Moss want? <BR> <u>I</u> dunno.... Ambassador to <u>Togo</u> somethin' <u>I</u> dunno... he... <BR> Maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>. <BR> Yeah...what was I talking about...? <BR> How long you been up you need a nap. <BR> Due in Nashville. <BR> <u>Nashville</u>...? <BR> We're gonna do the <u>Team Song</u>. <BR> You're tired Ronnie. <BR> Y'wanna follow the Cattle Drive?  Sleep in the Winter. What does <u>Moss</u> want...?  Matchmaker comes to the Levinsky Family.  Mr. Levinsky Mrs. Levinsky would you entertain an offer of marriage for your son Saul from Princess Margaret of Great Britain.  Well they think she isn't Jewish but she's well to-do a nice old family.  Alright yes they say.  We would consider such an offer.  Wonderful matchmaker says My Job is Half Done.  Now Look:  I got the <u>file</u> from the L.A. contingent I got the day-by-day of how...
4691,There's your old twenty-gauge and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell Jack I guess you deserve it. Right's right. <BR> Yeah. <BR> Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again. <BR> He sure as hell won't.
4692,I spoke to her and everything is all right. <BR> I what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning and she said... <BR> She told me. <BR> She did? <BR> I just saw her. <BR> In New York? <BR> What? <BR> You saw Kat in New York...  ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
4693,The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply. <BR> That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away. <BR> He doesn't have anything to cut with.
4694,X22. Read. <BR> Go ahead Ray. <BR> I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over. <BR> Okay Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts to leave the area move in. And hold him. Over.
4695,We got a mistrial you know. Joe -- did you hear what I said...? <BR> I don't want a mistrial.
4696,I'm at your service. <BR> Thank you. Mmmm that feels good. <BR> Oh sis. You're so tense.
4697,He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon. <BR> He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then Lord willing we'll try to bring him back.
4698,Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car? <BR> Hard to say.
4699,I have to go now. <BR> Is this really happening? <BR> I'm sorry.
4700,I was lookin' for you all day today. <BR> You were? <BR> Sure. I even thought about you when I woke up.
4701,"It is, after all, Sera, my money. <BR> Yes, of course. How much do you need? <BR> All of it. I need to buy many things... all of it!"
4702,You lost my money? <BR> You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles. <BR> Who is Friedman? <BR> The man who sold the boy to your brother. <BR> Im impressed. That information could have cost me Ł20000. <BR> Well I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead tonight Im convinced he is. That said I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
4703,Some other time. <BR> Excuse me? <BR> I'm not in the mood. <BR> And that's why you're leaving? <BR> It clearly is why. <BR> I want to fuck. <BR> And I don't.
4704,Piss off! <BR> Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money all right?... Come on I need you. Its important.
4705,There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box. <BR> No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it. 
4706,Like Don Maranzano. <BR> And if we don't invite Maranzano we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides. <BR> I'll handle the Boss. <BR> So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders but we're leadin'. <BR> How soon can we pull this off? <BR> I'm gettin' married in six weeks. I'll already be in Atlantic City which is probably the best place to do it anyway.
4707,You're still my Little Chief right? <BR> I'm trying to be Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
4708,That's the one I'd've picked for you myself! <BR> How much? <BR> Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition but you can feel can't you... and it's all in the feel believe me you feel that one around the block... <BR> It looks fine. How much will it be with my car...? <BR> You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you? <BR> Of course not. Please. <BR> Well... heck this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred. <BR> Five hundred. <BR> Aha! Always got time to argue money huh...? <BR> All right.
4709,Don't you think they'd just love another song instead? <BR> Now Sueleen you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.
4710,You're a married man am I right? <BR> Yes... <BR> Hard working have a wife and kids... <BR> Yes... <BR> I don't want to nail you. I just want to know who put you up to it. I'll give you a few days to think it over.  Call me. I can help. Who knows? Maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years.
4711,Don't tell anybody. <BR> Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's <BR> 247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor if ya think about it. <BR> Oh no I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it. <BR> No.  Please.
4712,You know what else? <BR> What? <BR> I can tell that she had just entered puberty. <BR> How? <BR> Well I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family right. <BR> Right. <BR> And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said you were cute when you were little. <BR> Yeah. <BR> And she goes yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago. I look younger without my makeup.
4713,And if that's not destiny I don't know what is. <BR> That's really romantic.
4714,You know I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke.  I could sense the chemistry between us. <BR> Really? <BR> Really...
4715,We're looking for him. In your opinion why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband? <BR> He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue. <BR> You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens. <BR> Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me? <BR> We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch. <BR> Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah but how many more are out there?
4716,Shut up Kevin.  Honey you-re not making sense ... <BR> It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.
4717,... just got 250000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag. <BR> Hey the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie. <BR> And I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada. <BR> Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor.  Interesting. You got a card?
4718,Why won't you tell me your name? <BR> It's only our first date.
4719,Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel throw her off the balcony put her in the car...Done. <BR> You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony? <BR> We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear. <BR> What about the blood? <BR> Someone goes to Walmart gets some buckets brushes mops Spic and Span the works. <BR> Have you ever done this before? <BR> The reality is you take away the horror of this situation take away the tragedy of the death take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned beaten into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. But that line exists and I see it.I see that line. Trust me. Adam. Trust me...I can take care of this.
4720,You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u> Stu. - Where are your pants? <BR> <u>Well</u> Miss Smarty if I didn't go out I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
4721,You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing. <BR> I did what you told me to. <BR> Yes you did. <BR> 'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do. <BR> Yeah.  Boy he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he? <BR> Sure did. <BR> Everything went to his head. 
4722,Don't mess in this Homer if you know what's good for you. <BR> How long's this been going on Muddy? <BR> Long enough. You ain't gonna stop it.
4723,Joel? It's Joel right? <BR> Yes? <BR> I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever I'm a little out of sorts today. <BR> That's okay. <BR>  <BR> It's no problem. Anyway I have some stuff I need to -- <BR> Oh okay. Well sure I'll just...  Take care then. <BR> Probably see you at the book store. <BR> Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
4724,"Another one, eh? <BR> This 'un come a long way 'fore he died. <BR> Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan."
4725,Myself and Mr. Pink? <BR> You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones period. Since no display cases are being fucked with no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds? <BR> When you're dealing with a store like this they're insured up the ass. They're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever. If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. Drops 'em right to the floor. Everyone jumps he falls down screaming blood squirts out his nose. Freaks everybody out. Nobody says fuckin' shit after that. You might get some bitch talk shit to ya. But give her a look like you're gonna smash her in the face next. Watch her shut the fuck up. Now if it's a manager that's a different story. The managers know better than to fuck around. So if one's givin' you static he probably thinks he's a real cowboy. So what you gotta do is break that son-of-a-bitch in two. If you wanna know something and he won't tell you cut off one of his fingers. The little one. Then you tell 'im his thumb's next. After that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies underwear. I'm hungry let's get a taco.
4726,I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere. <BR> Everybody else does. Why not you? <BR> You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island. <BR> Oh yeah? <BR> Matthew look at him. When I lived in Roxbury the media followed this man everywhere. He was bigger than ten movie stars.  Where's your white Lincoln limo?
4727,Wait what's that supposed to mean? <BR> I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.
4728,You cannot die. <BR> Would that Marcus had lived. <BR> Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son. <BR> He killed his father and then my family... <BR> Narcissus I have your family. They're alive.  All of them.
4729,There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast. <BR> Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating? <BR> Carrots. <BR> Raw? <BR> Uh-huh. Want one? <BR> No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat. <BR> You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for youcarrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught megoodnight! <BR> I hate the horrid stuff.
4730,What's going on? <BR> Mike there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it. <BR> What? Now?
4731,Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers. <BR> It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk. <BR> Oh. Right. Well let's try not to think about that.
4732,He totally freaked.  I've never seen him like this.  He's out of his fucking mind. <BR> That's okay as long as he believes it was Johnnie. <BR> Believes it!  Jesus it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know Corky I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous really nervous. <BR> It's all right Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does. <BR> What if he doesn't run? <BR> That means he probably will kill Johnnie. <BR> Oh Christ I got to get out of here! <BR> Listen if he doesn't run all you have to do is break down go to your bedroom and pack some things start crying saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out. <BR> okay all right. <BR> We're almost there Violet.  just hang on.
4733,Where are the minefields? <BR> All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends man? <BR> Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you.  I'll walk it. <BR> Ah look!  they probably know where the campers are
4734,Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still. <BR> Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might -- <BR> Shut up. I'm all right. <BR> Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
4735,My gentle Captain... I'm staying. <BR> I -- I don't understand... <BR> One day you will. <BR> You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy and have children and...
4736,Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled? <BR> Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
4737,What Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing? <BR> Barely. <BR> You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection won't you?
4738,I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip? <BR> I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned they're just doin' their job.
4739,--it would have been nice to have had this I sure would have liked to have had this-- <BR> --there's nothing new in it-- <BR> --it makes the break-in real--it's a major goddamn story--  --I'm not going to kick ass over this but I'd like you to know I hate getting beat I just hate it-- don't forget that I hate it--
4740,You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say? <BR> Not much.
4741,No we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley. <BR> Do you know Tom?
4742,Shit. <BR> What is it? <BR> I heard a noise. <BR> Where?
4743,No... It looks like your going to have a new court. <BR> What do you mean? <BR> The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it. <BR> And? <BR> We've been notified that they rejected the sentence...
4744,You killed them. <BR> It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too except he went nuts. Couldn't take it I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so. <BR> So you killed them? <BR> The way I figure it it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends. <BR> And now you're gonna kill me is that it? <BR> I didn't want it to turn out this way. <BR> Murphy don't you see what's happening? <BR> I think I see it pretty well. <BR> It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way. <BR> I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that. <BR> It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out. <BR> I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to pure and simple. <BR> I don't give a damn about the gold. <BR> I wish I could believe that. Either way you know what I've done. I've got no choice.
4745,Dad. <BR> I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
4746,...I meant the Leopard Skin... <BR> British Regiments drape their drums in Leopard Skins. <BR> Thank God this is America.
4747,One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and as a gift dependent on your satisfaction. <BR> You mean I don't like it he doesn't pay? <BR> It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer. <BR> You mean <u>dis</u>satisfied. <BR> That's right -- you're a left-brain word fetishist.
4748,'Figgers. <BR> ...He had a bald skull and... <BR> Hamidou.  Chief of the Guards. Don't fuck with him. He almost killed an Italian dude couple months ago.  Bad news. He try anything with you?
4749,He needs a doctor. <BR> I'll call us in. Dodge see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him.
4750,Was it great? <BR> It was okay. <BR> You'll always remember your first time. <BR> It was nice. <BR> So tell me do you like Ron? Is it serious? <BR> Come on Linda. It's just sex. <BR> Hey! That's my line!
4751,Well I should probably get going. <BR> No stay. Just for a little while.  Refill? <BR> No. I -- <BR> I know a man who needs a refill.
4752,No it was lovely. <BR> Hi Joel. So no jokes about my name?
4753,Shhh! Do you hear something? <BR> Yes sir. <BR> You try it. <BR> Me sir? <BR> Yeah.
4754,I don't know what you think you'll find anyway. <BR> Names a phone number something...  Listen Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
4755,I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel? <BR> Ugh ...
4756,Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear understand?!?  You have no choice in this don't think about winning think about staying alive.  I want the item and if you don't give it to me I'm gonna kill you. <BR> I don't have it with me... <BR> Bullshit! <BR> I swear... <BR> Then where is it? <BR> I sent it to myself in Paris. <BR> Sent it where? <BR> A post office box.
4757,My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil. <BR> I know the name. Why? <BR> Old friend of your father's.
4758,Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office. <BR> Who is it? <BR> I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
4759,But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost. <BR> Ma che cazzo!
4760,Alexander... I know you. <BR> Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for -- <BR> I've had it with you.  I'm leaving. <BR> Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
4761,Oh God! Give me the fuckin' name! <BR> Ch-Charlie M! <BR> Charlie M? <BR> Charlie M. <BR> Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker! <BR> Kill me you fuck kill me. <BR> Kill you  You motherfucker you!  Frankie do him a fuckin' favor.
4762,Oh shit ... <BR> Caesar this is Corky.  Corky Caesar. <BR> I'm sorry Christ I thought ... it's fucking dark in here.
4763,What? <BR> Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
4764,Please revel with me Aramis I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old I'm weak my strength is gone -- <BR> Be quiet you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying? <BR> I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here you'd have tears in your eyes. <BR> There are more important things than tits. <BR> Really?  If you can name me one thing one single thing that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips I will buy you a new cathedral.
4765,Walter. When I fill out my 302 do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation? <BR> Ray -- <BR> -- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here man. <BR> What'd you expect to hear? <BR> Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI Walter remember? Not National Geographic. <BR> What you call myths we call our history. <BR> It's not real. <BR> What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths. <BR> I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job and do it right and get the fuck outta here. <BR> You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
4766,Seventeen. <BR> Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are son? One little whacked-out crazy fella? <BR> Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head. <BR> Good. Keep it up and maybe one day you'll grow up and become a great man like me. 
4767,Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you. <BR> Me? <BR> It's classical.  Almost a textbook case...
4768,John you still there? <BR> I'm right here Dad. <BR> You all right? <BR> Yeah I think so... <BR> Don't worry Chief.  I'm not gonna let anything happen to her...no matter what.
4769,Jesus Tom Walls that crazy motherfucker. <BR> Used to be my partner.
4770,Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts. <BR> That's a good one. <BR> Yeah I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate. <BR> It's a good one all right.
4771,What the fuck are you... ? <BR> Where'd you get that gun? <BR> It's mine... <BR> We searched the house. <BR> Guess you missed it. <BR> Just... wait.  Just wait!  Okay... please I'm not kidding anymore...
4772,We'll be able to start this afternoon.  I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  Now that'll impress the Governor. <BR> Well bravo!  What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team.
4773,It matters to me. <BR> Okay donut.  Whatever you say.
4774,This is exactly what I don't want. <BR> I think it's out of your control.
4775,You know they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration when it's all said and done isn't China or Russia.  It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt. <BR> I believe you're right boss. <BR> ... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ... <BR> Sir? <BR> The presidency won't protect us Bob. We're beyond politics now ...
4776,Have you ever had anal intercourse? <BR> Yes. <BR> With how many people? <BR> Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure. <BR> Were they wearing condoms? <BR> Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.
4777,Listen it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do -- <BR> Just stop worrying.
4778,Who's this guy? Who's this guy? <BR> Oh he ain't nobody. <BR> You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert then let 'em show you where it's at. <BR> Angelo and Buster. <BR> Yeah but I'm not sure yet. <BR> They'll do it. <BR> And when I'm ready I'll say the words 'Go see the Jew.' <BR> Yeah. <BR> And you make it disappear you know what I mean? <BR> Yeah just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about? <BR> Did I say to do anything yet? I said I'm not sure... I'll let you know. I want to think about it. Where're these pricks at?
4779,You're the Indian FBI. <BR> That's right. Turn around.
4780,Keith Richards Dean Martin... <BR> Jack Kerouback Herman Melville Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise let me be heard...
4781,Somewhere on this island there exits the greatest predator that ever lived.  And the second greatest predator must take him down. <BR> But why? <BR>  <BR> It's called self-testing.  But in your case it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world clears the decks and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
4782,Agent Hadley. <BR> Do you know who this is? <BR> Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you. <BR> If you ever want to get those tapes meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.
4783,Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in? <BR> Because I want someone I can trust.
4784,Where's Spa. <BR> Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We'll meet you there.
4785,I look horrible. <BR> The other two -- the new ones. Where are they? <BR> I don't know.  But the boy he couldn't kill them. <BR> No... Not a boy...  Find out if they're dead.  And do something about that arm.  Honestly I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.
4786,Anybody know about that car outside? <BR> Yeah.   It's mine. <BR> No.   It's mine. <BR> The hell it is. <BR> I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it! <BR> And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here. <BR> Fuck you grease-ball! <BR> Fuck me?   Fuck you!
4787,It was Feyd?  It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring. <BR> The ring?... he was brought to us as is Baron.  I... <BR> You killed the doctor too soon you fool!
4788,Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp... <BR> <U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne? <BR> I beg your pardon? <BR> That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...
4789,It's a Noaa buoy. <BR> A what? <BR> Government weather. It's got a transmitter aboard.
4790,He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely... <BR> ...and he tells me to go fuck myself. <BR> What? <BR> Then he called me a faggot. <BR> So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out. <BR> What? Ho-  Hey come here.
4791,How much longer? <BR> Until we find something. <BR> I don't care about the overtime I'm hungry.  And cold.  And most of all bored.
4792,Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around. <BR> Except I won't have a father anymore. <BR> I'll see you all the time. I'll get a place right nearby. One room. No distractions. We'll talk.
4793,What are my choices? <BR> About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction. <BR> Where would they be going? <BR> We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
4794,Speaking of feeding things what about dinner? <BR> What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator too?  What's in it?
4795,Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in? <BR> No! <BR> I didn't mean with you in it. <BR> Okay you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
4796,You found her? <BR> There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going. <BR> We need you here. I can bring her in. <BR> No. I'll handle this.
4797,Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on we got to hide out! <BR> Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'. <BR> You're *trespassin'*! It ain't you lan' no more! An' that's the supr'tendant--with a gun!
4798,All right sugar what's on your mind? <BR> Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps. <BR> Like what? <BR> Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming. <BR> Help huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money does it? <BR> Don't rush me okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides it's not for me.  It's for our daughter. <BR> Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean you might have a daughter but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter. <BR> Her name is Felicity and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild. <BR> Stop it already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity? <BR>  <BR> I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name. <BR> I don't know who else to turn to Auggie. <BR> You've suckered me before darling remember? Why should I believe you now? <BR> Why would I lie to you Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to? <BR> That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember baby don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So instead of going to college I wind up in the navy for four years I watch men lose their arms and legs I nearly get my head blown off and you sweet Ruby McNutt you run off and marry that asshole Bill. <BR> You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think? <BR> Yeah well I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one I was clean out of paper. <BR> It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now but you were pretty hot to see me back then. <BR> You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first. <BR> It fizzled baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times didn't we? It wasn't all bad. <BR> A couple of moments I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity. <BR> And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds. <BR> You're conning me sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby. <BR> Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant and I didn't have much time. Say what you like but at least he gave my kid a name. <BR> Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days? <BR> Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago. <BR> Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday you know. <BR> I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own but I couldn't. She's in real bad Auggie. <BR> Nice try old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time. <BR> You're a cold-hearted bastard aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean Auggie? <BR> I know you think I'm lying to you but I'm not. Every word I told you is the God's honest truth.
4799,Hey come on it's quiet now. We can- we can start again. <BR> I can't. <BR> What- <BR> My head is throbbing. <BR> Oh you got a headache! <BR> I have a headache. <BR> Bad? <BR> Oswald and ghosts. <BR> Jesus!
4800,Yeah it was okay. <BR> Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked. <BR> The sets were good. <BR> The sets were excellent. Everything was big you know all the rubbish coke cans sweet wrappers dustbins so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
4801,I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities. <BR> Sneaking around with your brother? <BR> Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting. <BR> I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job. <BR> Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing. <BR> Why do you play at being drunk? <BR> How do you know I am playing?  Well the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die isn't he? <BR> I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany. <BR> Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it?  The Emperor himself didn't you know?  Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front?  Burning patriotism? Filial love?  He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough cash left in the treasury to... play Emperor.  Watch out for him Narcissus; he's inexperienced but... be careful.
4802,I don't know. <BR> What was her name? <BR> What's your name?
4803,You didn't see the killing or the body? How do you know there was a murder? <BR> Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain saws knives trunks with rope and a wife that isn't there any more. <BR> I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely. <BR> Go ahead Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.
4804,Game set and match Steven. You've outdone yourself. And I know it's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really happen to Ms. Marr? <BR> Asking the wrong person again. <BR> I mean did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch -- <BR> -- I pose you the same question -- <BR> -- and who's next on your list? <BR> If I had one Evelyn I think you know who'd be first and last -- <BR> -- oh for chrissake that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here -- <BR> -- that wasn't my original plan but it is starting to look more attractive -- <BR> -- thank you! All the cards finally on the goddamn table!
4805,Unbelievable. Some fag no offense - <BR> - none taken - <BR> - wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me. <BR> Any ideas who it could be? <BR> Blaine if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now. <BR> Where did you say she's from? <BR> Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas? <BR> Greg McConnell. <BR> The football stud? <BR> He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat. <BR> It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year. <BR> I don't think that bothered him. <BR> What do you mean? <BR> Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field. <BR> Are you shitting me? <BR>  <BR> Too bad he's in Kansas this summer. <BR> Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up. <BR> Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf? <BR> Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight. <BR> Outstanding. <BR> Don't think it's not going to cost you. <BR> 
4806,Wilbur the adopting couple is waiting in your office. <BR> Life is waiting.
4807,Hammer? <BR> How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...
4808,Wait a minute. <BR> Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch. <BR> All right.  What do we do now? <BR> We wait for Robert to wake up.
4809,Madam should sleep. <BR> I've done my hair differently -- do you like that? <BR> When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently. <BR> In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh think Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest Suzette. <BR> Yes Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train. <BR> Goodnight Suzette.
4810,It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in. <BR> Good night Daddy.
4811,What do you want from me? <BR> I . I don't know. <BR> What do you want?
4812,That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down remember? <BR> Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore. <BR> Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day and then I didn't like marry you? <BR>  <BR> Forget it Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time! <BR> Yeah well... I still have your underwear. <BR> I still have your virginity! <BR> Oh my God SHUT UP! <BR> What? Are you ashamed that we did it? <BR> No... <BR> Well at least you don't have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater. I'm a planet!
4813,Sami tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us. <BR> What for? <BR> We need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card.
4814,Dude our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip! <BR> Our moms suck!
4815,'Cardiff Giant.' That's us. <BR> You sure? <BR> Yeah. He said that's our account with the car service.
4816,Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword... <BR> Well how d'you think I feel? <BR> The Gods are asleep King Arnulf. <BR> YOU try to be nice to people when they're rude about your singing...
4817,... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget? <BR> No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus they're serious.  Why're we stopping? <BR> Run 'em over.
4818,Okay we're on the last present now... <BR> Last present! <BR> It's a big one...It's a...it's a boardgame!  Repeat!  Battleship -- Battleship the boardgame!
4819,What are you doing? <BR> Don't cross me... <BR> Nobody's going to do that! <BR> Really? <BR> I need you Swede I can't do this without you! <BR> I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with. <BR> I do I do...
4820,Hi. I could give you a ride if you need. <BR> No that's okay. Thanks though. <BR> You're sure? It's cold. <BR> I don't want to take you out of your way. <BR> It's okay. <BR> Yeah?
4821,I'm just trying to make a living and I don't want to become a local Joke. <BR> Mr. Gittes you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit. <BR> What? <BR> I said I'll drop it.
4822,He even played golf with the President. <BR> On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund it is my pleasure to present to you . . . <BR> But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green... <BR> ...this check for $62700000 for the new Tangiers.
4823,How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with? <BR> Umm. Altogether? <BR> Yes. Altogether. <BR> Hmm. I'd say eight maybe nine. <BR> How many times have you gone unprotected? <BR> With four of them I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait maybe it was three.
4824,Conditions have changed. Some people have become too powerful. <BR> I'll take care of the Boss.
4825,You're a little harsh on Todd. You're a little harsh on everybody.

What's in it for me? <BR> Thanks a lot. Seriously though by winning this bet you will prove to the world that you indeed know everything.  Isn't the rush of gambling on your cynical philosophy of life enough?
4826,"It's tough to rhyme. <BR> I believe in you.... <BR> Albania, Albania, Albania, James bond Villains. <BR> John Belushi... <u>Jim</u> Belushi... <BR> Jim Belushi...? <BR> Surest thing you know."
4827,You didn't find anything. <BR> Nothing. Here let's clear the path.
4828,Do what I tell you it's not a game. <BR> It's all a game don't bother me.
4829,Are you with me... are you awake...? <BR> Yeah. I'm awake. <BR> Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting? <BR> The Doctors. <BR> She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand... <BR> Read me what she said.
4830,Do you really not believe in God? <BR> It's okay there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
4831,At last... <BR> Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery. <BR> ...Gawain and Perceval Bors and Bohort Caradoc and Ector and all the others--lost to me. Only the echo of their voices remains in this empty hall. All I have left is the memory of their fellowship. Echoes and memories. I am a ghost of the King that once was...  ...Mordred is real alive my own flesh and blood. I will see him I must.
4832,I just hold it loosely with both hands? <BR> That's right sugar find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green. <BR> Grasp firmly. Then what? <BR> Line up where you want it. <BR> Yeah. <BR> Now swing it out a little to the right... <BR> Like this? <BR> No no that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead now honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it. <BR> Strokin'. Here goes nothin'.
4833,That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got Homer. Them hands you got they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right? <BR> I guess so...
4834,Well? <BR> I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
4835,She's just no good. <BR> What can I tell you Kid? You're right. When you're right you're right and you're right. <BR> Ain't worth thinking about.
4836,Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me and if you are you're a dead man! <BR> Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there? <BR> Nothing.
4837,Don't forget you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes. <BR> I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
4838,Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again. <BR> Help yourself.
4839,Hey we were saving that! <BR> For today I guarantee it. <BR> And who in God's name do you think you are....? <BR> John Hammond.  And I am delighted to finally meet you in person Dr Grant.
4840,"I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found. <BR> We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington. <BR> Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.? <BR> Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town. <BR> Have you examined them? <BR> No. Just fossils, far as I know."
4841,Oh just a old letter from a friend. <BR> No treasure maps huh? <BR> No.
4842,Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl? <BR> The doctor can tell but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise. <BR> Well it can really only go two ways. <BR> That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk. <BR> Junk? <BR> You know... it's parts... <BR> I know what junk is. <BR> Yeah? <BR> We definitely want it to have junk. <BR> Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
4843,It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it. <BR> Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible? <BR> I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture. <BR> I thought you were tinkering. <BR> I just mean... <BR> Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you Tripp. But...  ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
4844,What? <BR> Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
4845,"How'd you find me? <BR> Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight. <BR> You a reporter? <BR> I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN. <BR> Who sent you? <BR> I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas. <BR> Well, if you've got something to tell me, you've got as long as it takes me to hail a cab..."
4846,So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But as I'm sure you know the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities. <BR> Why would we do that?
4847,Theres nothing wrong with the line sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box. <BR> A call box? Thats odd. Where exactly? <BR> Penrhyndeudraeth North Wales. <BR> Can you tell me how you spell...
4848,What are you doing here? <BR> Is there someplace we can talk?
4849,No your going to eat it or it will go to waste. <BR> What's the matter with you?
4850,Yeah! <BR> But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney. <BR> Oh that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see I'm here to find out about <BR> I know I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever. <BR> Oh yeah?
4851,You want to find them. <BR> Yes. <BR> You want to kill them.
4852,No heart to burn. <BR> Everybody has a heart - except some people.  Of course I've got bicarb. There's a box in the pantry. We'll put your name on it. Max Fabian. It'll say there. Always. Just for you.
4853,Oh but OF COURSE children are going to see it!! <BR> Uh can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage- <BR> YOU JUST DON'T CARE! <BR> Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much. <BR> BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!! <BR> Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay I'm finished.
4854,Hi Tom. <BR> Marge Ripley's saying goodbye. <BR> I'll come down. <BR> Did you speak to my father?
4855,Andy!  I'm heading out the door. <BR> But Mom I can't find him! <BR> Well honey just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon! <BR> Okay...
4856,Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within. <BR> They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within. <BR> Death may be the result....  Are you sure? <BR> I must do this for Paul but what of my unborn child?
4857,Where you off to -- ? <BR> Thought I'd go for a ride -
4858,Jeanne's alive! <BR> Good. <BR> We have to press home the attack! <BR> Sound the retreat... <BR> But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on! <BR> I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night! <BR> But that was her order! <BR> I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed!  Look at the mess we're in!  That's her mess not mine...!  We're worse off then if she'd never come at all!  ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!
4859,Time to quit. <BR> Just like that? <BR> Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette. <BR> What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass. <BR> Would you stop with that... <BR> Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all you quit smoking just like that. <BR> The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company Vincent is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns and this is a job -- like any other job. <BR> Why then Sam don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely if you are a hired gun you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for. <BR> Because I don't walk away. <BR> Why not? <BR> It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends is he not? <BR> Closest and oldest. <BR> And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor Vincent that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do Vincent is to finish my job. <BR> And when you finish?  What then?  This package whatever it is do you give it to the CIA?  Do you really think they deserve it? <BR> That's a good question. <BR> Do you have a good answer? <BR> No I don't.
4860, <BR> Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
4861,"That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you? <BR> I'm - still in training at the Academy. <BR> Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me? <BR> We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified? <BR> Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please."
4862,People are dependable. <BR> I don't know if I can say that.
4863,I'm all for them owning casinos getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony isn't it Wesley? <BR> IT SURE IS!!
4864,Oh I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy to try to work out solutions to their problems. But you see I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber. <BR> You don't understand anything. <BR> I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously.
4865,I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning. <BR> No way! He just called him a dick. <BR> God. People exaggerate so much at this school.
4866,When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding? <BR> I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer. <BR> You're kidding. <BR> They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me. <BR> You know the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible. <BR> I know. Look I can't talk now. Later. Later?
4867,I feel like I got you into this. <BR> Forget it. <BR> I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But it's not is it? <BR> I'm sorry I left you hanging up there. <BR> It doesn't matter.  Really.  I'm just sorry you got chewed out.
4868,Harp let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't? <BR> What that?
4869,I know. <BR> You need to see a doctor Mr. Tripp. An internist. And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist as well. <BR> She told you about... <BR> Her dog yes. <BR> Actually it was her husband's dog...
4870,Okay we're back in. <BR> That was beautiful to watch Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist. <BR> Well thank you Mary.
4871,You look good damn good considering you're an old man now! <BR> Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
4872,Really? <BR> Well I didn't want to assume. <BR> Aw c'mon live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car. <BR> Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
4873,"Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money. <BR> No? <BR> No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul. <BR> I know that... <BR> ...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand. <BR> Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job. <BR> Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck. <BR> Whatever that means. Open your presents."
4874,Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work? <BR> The wind blows... the fire burns... <BR> I know all that Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones. <BR> ...The rain falls...
4875,I can call them... I can call my dad. <BR> But you won't.
4876,Is Jody still awake? <BR> She just turned off her light.
4877,Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked. <BR> I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about.  You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
4878,Mr. Clear Moon. <BR> Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
4879,What's wrong? <BR> I don't know who I am. <BR> What do you mean? You're Rita. <BR> I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!
4880,Prayers have no power to save. The knife can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed. These are saviours...our new saviours...our only saviours. <BR> We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will... <BR> One day a dead man will refuse to return and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe. <BR> You can believe this Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done. <BR> No. You won't be able to do it. He will rise. He will rise and you... you will die.
4881,If ever I need a Boss Joe. <BR> Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
4882,What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'. <BR> Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit and won't have no choice but to start the war. <BR> Why's it gotta be Tommy! <BR> Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive Maranzano can't win without you.
4883,Where the hell's the laundry detergent? <BR> Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
4884,"These guys are here to help you, Betty. <BR> I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did."
4885,Have you checked the... <BR> Attic garage basement nothing. <BR> Take the neighborhood.
4886,Sit down. <BR> Is everything okay? <BR> You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened. <BR> Thank you. <BR> About the alibi --
4887,You said it. <BR> So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
4888,Take a drink. Calm down! <BR> I say we gotta take action. Now.
4889,Genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings. An incontrovertible motive. And definite footprints on Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs house. <BR> When did we get that? <BR> Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van -- <BR> -- I know. I fed it and I can't get rid of -- <BR> You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard to Indian Country. I need you behind me Ray. Not pulling against me. <BR> I'm not trying to pull against you Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed. <BR> Your first homicide that's gonna happen Ray... <BR> I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer. <BR> Ray. I never get into bed with somebody unless I know for sure. Just the way I was raised.
4890,Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over. <BR> Oh poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
4891,You're not going to die. <BR> What did you say? <BR> Shut up. You're going to die and he's not. Got it.
4892,I can't. The police have it by now. <BR> Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
4893,See my hips? <BR> Yep. <BR> I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius. <BR> When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain. <BR> But you were pulling your hips last night. <BR> So...Wanta make love?
4894,Are you all right? <BR> Yes. <BR> Do you want to go on?
4895,Where'd Twombley get shot? <BR> In the chest. <BR> No I mean whereabouts. <BR> A half mile in along the old lumber road. <BR> You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb. <BR> The ambulance guys lugged him up. <BR> You stayed away? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Where'd you get the blood? <BR> What blood? <BR> On your sleeve. <BR> Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing playing cop? <BR> I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering that's all. What'd he do to shoot himself I mean? <BR> Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off. <BR> I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something. <BR> Well I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said. <BR> Sure you did. <BR> What? <BR> Saw him do it? <BR> What the fuck you telling me Wade? I never seen the guy get shot I told you that. <BR> You musta seen him get shot. I know you did. <BR> Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense man.
4896, <BR> Talia just because you happen to be Jewish doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body... <BR> Yes it does.
4897,Pop for Christ's sake! <BR> You think you can take me now? Come on try.
4898,Just a man. A knight in the King's service. <BR> You're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
4899,Your place or mine? <BR> Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics I am within the framework of a baseball season monogamous. <BR> Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause It might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around--  Great deal.  You get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing-  So what do you really want?  You wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic?  Or do you want a guy?
4900,Twenty years I've led men to die. For me it was the glory of Rome. But that was something.  If it wasn't that then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore -- but that was something!  These men here are butchered for laughs!  Their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line! <BR> For the sake of the Gods you're not leading these men?  How like my father you are.  You 'believe'... I guess that's why you're still alive.
4901,Stan? What's going on? <BR> The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere. <BR> Okay what happened right before he disappeared? <BR> I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee. <BR> Well where was Patrick? <BR> He went home sick. <BR> Jesus. All right what's the address. <BR> 1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E Rockville Center.
4902,We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism. <BR> In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?! <BR> Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early. <BR> And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all. <BR> Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves.
4903,...So maybe the best thing would be to take care of that right here in Brainerd. <BR> What's this sir? <BR> That's my license and registration. I wanna be in compliance.
4904,Please don't have me arrested please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me! <BR> How did you get in here? <BR> I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess I fell asleep. <BR> You were just looking around... <BR> That's all. <BR> What for? <BR> You probably won't believe me. <BR> Probably not. <BR> It was for my report. <BR> What report? To whom? <BR> About how you live what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that. You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the girls' high schools? <BR> I've heard of them. <BR> Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president. <BR> Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn isn't it? <BR> Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn. Barbara Stanwyck Susan Hayward - of course they're just movie stars.
4905,Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma. <BR> They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
4906,We're not yet open for business I'm afraid. <BR> Shame. I was recommended. By a friend. <BR> Really? <BR> Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say a Tuscan hillside in June? <BR> Normally we'd be eager to oblige -- <BR> Seriously? <BR> Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods. <BR> You don't say. How real does it feel? <BR> As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason. <BR> There are limits? <BR> The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch. <BR> No need. I'll call again.
4907,I think he knows that Joey. <BR> Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need...
4908,How's that? <BR> Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody. <BR> Is that so? Well have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph? <BR>  <BR> Now get this mug. You've got the kind of chin I just love to touch. And if you don't get out of here I'm going to hang one right on it.
4909,Ricky's not wearing one. <BR> Ricky can you put on a seat belt?
4910,"Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight? <BR> No, I didn't have to."
4911,I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it have you? <BR> I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it. <BR> You'd recognize it if you tasted it. <BR> I doubt it darling. <BR> Well Q certainly will. And given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour... <BR> You want to keep him happy. <BR> If he's happy...  I'm happy.
4912,Yeah but how are you supposed to make the first move? <BR> Like this!
4913,That's right. <BR> Isn't it a little late? <BR> Hold on a sec.  Lois you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?
4914,Oh God please!  This can't be happening!  I can't be plastic!  A plastic man?! <BR> Daniel! <BR> I'm a plastic man!  A plastic man!
4915,...Exactly what do you know about me Mr. Gittes? <BR> Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers. <BR> 'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend. <BR> His girlfriend? <BR> Yes his girlfriend. <BR> You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando? <BR> Yes. She's disappeared hasn't she? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Doesn't that strike you as odd? <BR> No. She's probably scared to death. <BR> Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her? <BR> Maybe. <BR> If Mulwray was murdered she was probably one of the last people to see him. <BR> You didn't see Mulwray much did you? <BR> No. <BR> When was the last time?
4916,That's considerate of you. <BR> Yeah that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it. <BR> I'm not interested in your literary recommendations. <BR> Well maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance
4917,But you did suspect me. <BR> Not for a moment. <BR> You're playing games. <BR> Aren't we all Mrs. Peel? <BR> I thought you played by the rules. <BR> I thought you didn't. <BR> I'm playing to win. <BR> Winning isn't everything. <BR> Please don't tell me it's how you play the game. <BR> After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
4918,Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you! <BR> But I don't know Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble. <BR> You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of trouble.
4919,Oh no--he's shaking off the sign Jackson.  Big mistake... <BR> He'll learn.
4920,The Dolphin was a symptom. <BR> Of what? <BR> Of a fight he can't win out here. <BR> It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...
4921,And that's the best angle of the courtyard? <BR> That's the only angle. <BR> What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something. <BR> Hang on... 
4922,Look Anne you're not serious about this are you? <BR> Of course I am Stewart. <BR> Now let's get this settled
4923,Shit.  Hey can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already? <BR> It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
4924,...the Archdiocese called up they said who was our attorney 'cause the case is coming to trial... <BR> I doubt we'll have to go to trial... <BR> ...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way. <BR> I completely understand... <BR> We just...
4925,Rogan Laurel. You also have a Rogan Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it. <BR> Take it yourself. Take a date. <BR> I don't have a date. I don't want a date.
4926,I could break up some bresh if you want me ma'am. <BR> You want to get ast to eat hunh? <BR> Yes ma'am. <BR> Didn' you have no breakfast? <BR> No ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along. <BR> Didn' none of these have no breakfast?
4927,Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense. <BR> Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast volatile predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex. <BR> So your dead hubby shot me twice three of my customers have been eaten and there are angry creatures outside? <BR> He only shot you once. <BR> Huh? <BR> He shot you the other time.
4928,Serious stuff... <BR> Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
4929,I'll deal with the police. <BR> Remember what I said you can't... <BR> Trust me.
4930,Whoa nine months? <BR> Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
4931,God you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid ugly sexual liason. Why I'd be proud of that sort of thing. <BR> Maybe you should go Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful. <BR> For my life? At a discussion group? I think not. <BR> For the flat. <BR> No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl that friend of yours the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry. <BR> She hated you -- <BR> Well she had problems -- <BR> -- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life. <BR> -- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. But like they say you know she's got to want to change hasn't she?
4932,Lisa Sherman? <BR> Yeah. Who is she? <BR> I don't know. Where did you hear that name. <BR> I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer. <BR> What? <BR> That's what he said. <BR> Did he say anything else about her? <BR> No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight. <BR> I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind. <BR> No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen. <BR> Not that I know of.
4933,I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow... <BR> The dead can wait.
4934,Hi this is Julia.  Please leave a message after the tone. <BR> Hey Ma it's me.  Checking in.  Probably at work.  Anyways I'll see you tomorrow night.  Love you.
4935,The difference is I can have sex with someone I just met someone I hardly know but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself. <BR> Do you think you know me like that? <BR> I think ...
4936,"Tell tell tell me again. <BR> ....we landing? <BR> Tell me again. <BR> Lookit don't worry about it.  It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down will... <BR> We can't <u>afford</u> a war. <BR>  <BR>  <BR> What's it gonna cost?  <BR>  <BR> Who would find out? <BR> ...the...  <BR> The American people""""?"" <BR> Yes <BR> Who's gonna tell'em. <BR> ...but... <BR> What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>. <BR> ...you want us to go to War... <BR> ...that's the general idea. <BR> Why? <BR> Why <u>not</u>, what've they ever done for <u>us</u>...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 <u>Bomber</u>... <BR> ...they sound what? <BR> <u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em... <BR> Hold on, hold on, hold on: <BR> Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know. <BR> <u>Who</u>? <BR> Well, I'm <u>working</u> on it...."
4937,Fine Chief. <BR> Gimme the keys. <BR> NO but I will lock you in. <BR> What? <BR> We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral.
4938,"You looking for him for some other reason? <BR> Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination."
4939,"Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute. <BR> The hell with 'em."
4940,You rally think this'll draw the parent? <BR> I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles all the way back to its den just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill. <BR> Killing lessons?  Heartwarming. <BR> Rex won't be any different.  It'll come. <BR> You're kidding yourself.  An adult T-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly.  It acts the way people wish they could that's why everyone's fascinated by it.  If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only ninety-nine percent would --
4941,You know something? Ive just seen so much ugliness I dont think Id mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  Id hoped to have a private word with Adonis but if thats the way you want it. <BR> What are you doing? You cant. I... <BR> Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser Deborah? And then your brothers not buried yet. As I said earlier an autopsy will... <BR> He... He is dead!  MY HUSBAND IS DEAD!  Call my parents. Theyll tell you. Call them!
4942,You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk? <BR> Not all Tradition is bad Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
4943,All right... where did you see her? <BR> She's in my biology class. <BR> Did you get her number? <BR> No. <BR> Did you get her name? <BR> No. It's too soon. <BR> It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes. <BR> Well what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?' <BR> I would. Yeah. <BR> Really? <BR> I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her. <BR> You tell me Mike. What do I do? <BR> Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.
4944,...and you don't have to put up a dime Roger. <BR> All right Bud... let's do it.
4945,No but there are four guys back there you might check out. <BR> Thanks buddy.
4946,You really want to know? <BR> Yes. <BR> It's because I don't trust myself with you.  I took a vow and because of you I'm tempted to break it. Don't destroy that for me. Please.
4947,You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day. <BR> I haven't come to you. <BR> But you're here. So you must have come to me.
4948,You know how to fly this thing? <BR> It's like a cab isn't it?
4949,...who is this guy...? <BR> Act Two:  and then Act Two... <BR> We don't need an Act Two. <BR> And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two? <BR> We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days till the Election. <BR> ...it's a Teaser! <BR> It's a teaser absolutely right
4950,And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson. <BR> Yeah intensive care ward.  My God-hey Max I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye.
4951,Safety on? <BR> Yeah. <BR> This way. <BR> Sun's gettin high. <BR> Deers have ears too.
4952,Now Mr. Slade you're in room 315. <BR> Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here. <BR> Yes sir. <BR> Is it a good room? <BR> I can take you down there. <BR> Just tell me. Wait here... Do you have change of a hundred? <BR> Not on me sir. <BR> Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty. <BR> Are you sure? <BR> Yeah. Take it. <BR> Thank you very much sir. <BR> So? <BR> What sir? <BR> Is it the good room? <BR> All the suites are about the same. <BR> Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms. <BR> Honestly the suites are all about the same. <BR> What if I gave you forty? <BR> It's as good a suite as we have unless you want two bedrooms. <BR> No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty. <BR> Thank you sir. <BR> Where's the place to go tonight? <BR> As far as...? <BR> Nightlife. Where's the hot ass? <BR> Women? <BR> Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway. <BR> I don't know Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in though. <BR> Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is. <BR> It's on West Broadway. <BR> See you later.
4953,Aahhh...  So what color is it? <BR> What? <BR> The LeSabre! <BR> Maroon.  I stole it. <BR> What? <BR> He wasn't going to let us use it so I just took it. <BR> Oh I wish we could just get in it and drive and drive and drive! <BR> Yeah me too. <BR> Sorry hon. Happy Birthday... <BR> I gotta go make dinner.
4954,C'mon Tom pick up a job. <BR> You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call. <BR> Let's get in a fight then. <BR> Who with? <BR> That's your job. Just keep driving keep moving. No stopping. We're sharks. We stop too long we die.
4955,The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice? <BR> Only because it's expected of her.
4956,Good morning everybody  Well maybe it isn't a good morning huh?  Anne did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you? <BR> Have you seen this?  <BR> Yes - the worm! <BR> I beg your pardon? <BR> He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him! <BR> 
4957,This looks like new grass to you? <BR> It looks pretty green for this climate.
4958,Yes? <BR> It's Sim.  We're almost there. <BR> Mr. Sim watch out!  O'Brien escaped and could be on his way!
4959,Are you all right? <BR> Yes... You woke me up... Its the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman? <BR> Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. Ill give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont all right? <BR> Paul Lamont...? <BR> Yeah. Goodnight Mrs De Moraes.
4960,He's out by the pool right now. <BR> Right now? <BR> Oh and I forgot to tell you.  He's here with his mother.
4961,Sorry I'm late. <BR> You're not. <BR> Where's Bill? <BR> Sleeping. <BR> Where are you going? <BR> Out.
4962,Well you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine! <BR> Jesus I didn't say it was. <BR> Well it's not. You're not a lion in a pride!  These kids acting like lions with their unplanned pregnancies and their Sunny Delights.
4963,So have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet? <BR> Well sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl. <BR> Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know gay? <BR> God pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno huh? <BR> My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean Zeus had other lays but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross. <BR> That suits you. <BR> Uh thanks. <BR> You know not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this. <BR> I weighed my options. But after all this I'm glad I didn't you know get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys. <BR> You're something else.
4964,Do you see any family resemblance here? <BR> You can't stay Kelly that's it. It's too dangerous.
4965,Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy! <BR> Of course.  I'm a terminator.
4966,Oh for God's sake! <BR> See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card.  I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program.
4967,Where the hell is Air One? <BR> That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction. <BR> Did he raise the Kids? <BR> Last transmission said ten juve- niles. <BR> Yeah?  Then what? <BR> Then nothing.  If you see him tell him to switch to an operational frequency or give me a status report yourself. <BR> Did you say Cable Junction? <BR> That's what he said. <BR> When? <BR> 1530 hours.  Might still be there. Base out.
4968,I'm fine baby. We're all okay. We were lucky. <BR> I'd better go report this...
4969,You think they went left? <BR> I don't know why I think they went right.
4970,I don't know no Grace Skinner. <BR> You knew her. You married her in 1963.
4971,He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class? <BR> Lit 101 got canceled so I stopped home and brought you some lunch. <BR> What is it? <BR> Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne. <BR> Really?  You're the best. <BR> I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.  Hi Randal.
4972,I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went? <BR> Matter of fact I do. <BR> Where? <BR> Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up. <BR> What's the maid's address? <BR> She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you. <BR> No Gittes you'll show us. <BR> What for? <BR> If she's not there you're going downtown and you're staying there til she shows up. <BR> Gee Lou I'm doing the best I can. <BR> Tell us about it on the way to Pedro.
4973,Why not call for help? <BR> For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
4974,It's them.  They did this. <BR> It's a flat tire.  That's all. <BR> How do you know? <BR> We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself. <BR> Okay... okay.
4975,You cannot run from your destiny Conner. <BR> Perhaps -- but if I must face it let it find me for I shall search for it no more.
4976,You don't think either one of us could ever change? <BR> Right now it doesn't seem so.
4977,No. That was Higgins .... <BR> Jonathan Quayle Higgins ...
4978,What? <BR> I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes. <BR> It couldn't have been. <BR> It was him.  I'm positive. <BR> It's impossible! <BR> Caesar I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
4979,I have to talk to you. <BR> What do you want? <BR> Come on. Let's get a drink. <BR> Don't touch anything.
4980,And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while. <BR> Smile? <BR> Yeah.  Smile.  You know.  People smile right? Watch.
4981,It's the guard in the storeroom. <BR> We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows. <BR> There's some film cans in the far corner of the room underneath one of the windows.
4982,They were early. <BR> What are you talking about? <BR> They just left didn't they? <BR> What are you drunk?
4983,You know how to get there? <BR> Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there but easy enough. <BR> Good.
4984,Well...flashlight? <BR> I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me. <BR> If I do you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here. <BR> Who's Clark? One of your colleagues? <BR> Not exactly. He's kind of a rewrite man. Actually he's a bit dull if you know what I mean.
4985,I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore! <BR> All right. Be careful. <BR> You fucked with me for the last time! <BR> Okay yeah.
4986,Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again. <BR> Sorry. Look... you seem like a nice girl. I'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.
4987,The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know? <BR> Ball park sausages. <BR> You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want? <BR>  <BR> Easy Micheal. <BR> He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
4988,By the way Laurence were you here last time your mistresss brother came over? You know just before he disappeared? <BR> I work here sir. Im here most of the time. <BR> You wouldnt recall if the brothers-in-law left together would you? <BR> You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait? <BR> No. Thank you. Ill be fine...
4989,You remember the first time we met Finnegan? I think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off Sumatra for those two Chinese...what did we use to call them? <BR> Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason? <BR> No it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box. <BR> You know what they say...the classics are eternal.
4990,Frank Kosinski.  Here's the address.  Go see him.  Ask him. <BR> Thank you.  Elisabeth I didn't mean to...
4991,It is honor you serve and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor! <BR> An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed! <BR> Why do you follow him d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor! <BR> No man is all bad... or all good.  I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can help him.
4992,Uh Buzz?!  We missed the truck! <BR> We're not aiming for the truck!
4993,Don't know that it does. <BR> Well then how 'bout maybe we call someone? <BR> Hasn't been a telephone in this House in over 60 years.
4994,I can see what you looked like as a kid. <BR> You knew me as a kid. <BR> Yeah but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now this way. <BR> What way? <BR> After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person. <BR> It's nice.
4995,Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory? <BR> I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
4996,Kane.  Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane? <BR> One moment sir.
4997,Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas. <BR> I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin' an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well sir he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her an' I give her a prayin' over but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that. <BR> Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'! <BR> Shore it is. It always is this time a year.
4998,It looks just like a regular Mustang -- <BR> Don't go there Toby --
4999,Oh. <BR> We're waiting on Carmine. <BR> Yeah we're lookin' for Carmine.
5000,Morning! <BR> Morning. <BR> So? How'd it go last night? <BR> With who? <BR> Well I know how it went with Cecile. She won't shut up about it. How'd it go with Mrs. Jesus?
5001,Please don't cry. Please honey. <BR> What are you sorry for? <BR> I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought you know we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy like we used to. <BR> I want to go home. <BR> You can't.
5002,It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at. <BR> Tell that Vernon to mind his own business Muddy. <BR> I told him that you all is sick. <BR> Tell him what you want Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today.
5003,Hey Buzz!!  You're flying!! <BR> This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style! <BR> Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!
5004,That's who you are too Emma. <BR> Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
5005,Don't take any chances.  Call for back-up this time! <BR> Don't worry -
5006,Dad I'm sorry.... <BR> Stay here.  Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
5007,What is it? What happened? <BR> Don't ask any questions. Come on!
5008,So we're gonna knock 'em both off? <BR> If it comes to that. Yeah.
5009,It was fine. <BR> I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night. <BR> I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends. <BR> 
5010,Gotta be another way up Frank. <BR> Then fuckin' find it.  I'm going for the girl.
5011,Oh my god... this is his house... _we're in his fucking house_... <BR> Janet goddamnit what's going on? <BR> Jas... Jason Voorhees... he's here...
5012,What about Margie? <BR> What about her? <BR> Well do you still plan to get married? <BR> Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose but it's worth it.
5013,All right. <BR> I'll getcha a piece. <BR> Yeah... so listen-you drive? <BR> Do I drive? Uh no I gotta-I gotta problem with driving. <BR> Oh you do? <BR> Yeah. I got uh I got a license but I have too much hostility. <BR> Oh right. <BR> Nice car. <BR> Huh? <BR> You keep it nice.  Can I ask you is this-is this a sandwich? <BR> Huh? Oh yeah.
5014,Sorry Dick.  She's a little tipsy. <BR> You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her. <BR> It's a thing she does.  She talks at night. <BR> Talks all day too!  How the hell can you put up with her John? <BR> What the hell -- I love her.  And she's great in bed.
5015,Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere. <BR> C'mon. Let's go.
5016,You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd legate... <BR> This is Cos this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you... <BR> I'm mentioning you in tomorrow's athlete's section legate.  So I'd love to know your birth sign; it effects how people bet.  And perhaps you could tell me a bit about... well who are you?
5017,Bruce at the rate you're going you can't even save yourself. <BR> Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
5018,Well just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me? <BR> Okay I'm thinking. <BR> No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me? <BR> Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do? <BR> There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have? <BR> One. <BR> So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me. <BR> Okay. <BR> Now I know a few things. I know you have had a rough day. You're probably thinkin' I don't know the half of it but in actual fact I know every part of it. The business of gittin' thrown off your movie the heartache of seeing your wife with another man... losin' access to that precious film vault...
5019,Yah thanks Stan it's a pretty - <BR> What kind of finder's fee were you looking for? <BR> ...Huh?
5020,We make our own choices and we pay our own prices.  I think we're more alike than you want to admit. <BR> What about that guy this morning? <BR> You mean Shelly? <BR> Don't tell me you're a workaholic. <BR> No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman. <BR> I suppose he just wants to watch.
5021,Are you sure? <BR> Am I sure? <BR> Are you sure? <BR> Am I sure about what? <BR> Do you really want to buy those cigarettes? <BR> Are you serious? <BR> How long have you been smoking? <BR> What is this a poll?
5022,That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there. <BR> I won't. <BR> Don't. Think Bailey. <BR> Alright alright...I'll call you back.
5023,Welsh again. <BR> Okay so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.  No-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
5024,Drug evasion with.... <BR> triple three triple three! easy..... <BR> Drug evasion with assorted perversions <BR> Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.
5025,I mean it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to -- <BR> No I don't want to bug you if you're trying to -- <BR> It's okay really. <BR> Just you know to chat a little maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train I mean of course. <BR> Rockville Center. <BR> Get out! Me too! What are the odds? <BR> The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders right? <BR> Ucch really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world huh? Yeah that's me: book slave there for like five years now. <BR> Really? Because -- <BR> Jesus is it five years? I gotta quit right now. <BR> -- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before. <BR> Well I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead. <BR> I don't have one. <BR> I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me. <BR> I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you. <BR> Ah the hair.  Blue right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name huh? <BR> I like it. <BR> Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering. <BR> Yeah. Tom Waits says it in -- <BR> Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song? <BR> I can't remember. <BR> Anyway this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace Yellow Fever Green Revolution. That'd be a job coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole. <BR> I don't really know how -- <BR> Purple Haze Pink Eraser. <BR> You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be? <BR> Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it. <BR> I'm sure you would. <BR> My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs. <BR> You sure? That doesn't sound -- <BR> I think. Anyway I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You? <BR> Oh I doubt that's the case. <BR> Well you don't know me so... you don't know do you? <BR> Sorry. I was just trying to be nice. <BR> Yeah I got it.
5026,Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski. <BR> What of it? <BR> It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are - and where. They haven't heard from you for three years... <BR> What of it?
5027,Unless you collected on the insurance... <BR> What are you people talking about? <BR> He's with them.
5028,You used to be on the job? <BR> Yeah long time ago.  I know you? <BR> I look familiar? <BR> No.  What house you work?
5029,This is the home of an angel. <BR> You OK out there? <BR> Yes. Take your time. I'm fine.
5030,Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party... <BR> I thought you were going to be late- <BR> When I'm guest of honor? <BR> I had no idea you were even here. <BR> I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing. <BR> That never stopped you before. <BR> Well we started talking she wanted to know all about Hollywood she seemed so interested... <BR> She's a girl of so many interests. <BR> It's a pretty rare quality these days. <BR> She's a girl of so many rare qualities. <BR> So she seems. <BR> So you've pointed out so often. So many qualities so often. Her loyalty efficiency devotion warmth affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
5031,Is this you? <BR> No it's Tom's. Splendid eh? <BR> Golly. Who's paying for this?
5032,What is it now? <BR> I'm losing my blood! <BR> You're losing your blood? <BR> Yes! <BR> Nonsense! ... It's here! ... Your blood ...
5033,Two right? <BR> Uh better make it one. <BR> You usually get two. <BR> Yeah I know but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health. <BR> Ah-hah.
5034,...like the water purifiers? <BR> What? <BR> Or the vitamins? Or the...?
5035,He's got your prick in his back pocket son and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it. <BR> No what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself. <BR> What you see son is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet. <BR> That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim. <BR> Boy if that's what you think I must've really screwed up my job as a father.
5036,Four reels sevens across three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are? <BR> Shoot it's gotta be in the millions maybe more. <BR> Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me? <BR> Well it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you. <BR> You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on? <BR> Well there's no way to determine that Sam. <BR> Yes there is. An infallible way! They won! <BR> Well it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes. <BR> Hey... Ward you're pissin' me off. Now you're insulting my intelligence. What do you think I'm a fuckin' idiot? You know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels.
5037,Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go? <BR> I want to have a baby. <BR> Let's talk about it later. <BR> No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby. <BR> I don't think we're ready. <BR> You're not ready. <BR> Clementine do you really think you could take care of a kid?
5038,Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream? <BR> Sure Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream? <BR> My friend the clitoris told me. <BR> Wow I have a clitoris too. <BR> Really? Where the hell do you keep it? It's huge.
5039,How's freedom kid pretty fuckin' good ain't it? <BR> It's a change. <BR> Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin? <BR> Sure. <BR> Take a seat.
5040,It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school. <BR> It's very convincing. <BR> It used to shoot these little paper caps but they don't make them anymore. The caps.
5041,You mean that hitch-hiker? Little short fella with a pale face? <BR> I guess that's what he looked like. <BR> We just picked him up on the way in. He went away this mornin' when the rate dropped. <BR> What'd he look like again? <BR> Short fella. Pale face. <BR> Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face? <BR> I didn't see nothin'. <BR> Okay. Go on.
5042,Get your fucking hands off my daughter! <BR> Mom he just fixed our car. <BR> Jackie get in the car. NOW!
5043,I have no idea how to spit this out. <BR> Hon did you get expelled? <BR> No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion. <BR> Well I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
5044,I don't think I like this. <BR> You're not supposed to.
5045,Hello. <BR> What happened to that guy? <BR> What guy? <BR> That guy the one that died.
5046,But that's tomorrow. <BR> Tomorrow.  Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
5047,You fuckin' wish. <BR> You tried to fuck me in my father's office you sick bastard. Look Vic whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean I like you a lot - <BR> Eddie if I was a pirate I wouldn't throw you to the crew. <BR> No you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it. <BR> I might break you Nice Guy but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound. <BR> Now ain't that a sad sight daddy walks into jail a white man walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
5048,What? Come on Paisley. <BR> Our Steven not only disguises himself. <BR> Yes. <BR> He goes to the theater armed.
5049,LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself. <BR> You. <BR> Who better to usher in the Blood Tide?
5050,Just kidding. About 10cc. <BR> Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
5051,Now Vic was tellin' me he's got a parole problem. <BR> Really? Who's your P.O.?
5052,"You told me you had answers. <BR> Yeah, well I don't have them all. <BR> You've been using me -- <BR> I've been using you?! <BR> You didn't know my father -- <BR> I told you -- he and I were old friends -- <BR> You're a liar. You lied to me to gather information for you. For your goddamn books. Didn't you?"
5053,"Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings. <BR> Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for."
5054,"Yeah baby. Everything's great. <BR> Well, can you come back inside? <BR> Yeah. Sure. <BR> Now? <BR> Yeah. Look honey, I'll be right in. I just...we're just taking care of some Groomsmen last minute business."
5055,Larry I'm gonna kill him. <BR> Goddamn you Joe don't make me do this! <BR> Larry I'm askin' you to trust me on this. <BR> Don't ask me that. <BR> I'm not askin' I'm betting.
5056,You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you? <BR> A passenger...
5057,Alright Henry -- we're gonna go your way.  Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss! <BR> There's no other choice. <BR> 
5058,Dubious but special honor Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright bar's open. <BR> Yes please!
5059,This theory the letter he left for you the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself. <BR> I just don't believe that! <BR> You don't want to dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow -- <BR> Such as? <BR> What a waste of lives and opportunities and --
5060,Did you see who that was? <BR> Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad too. <BR> He is just wonderful. <BR> I'1l get your bag.
5061,Nothing further your Honor... <BR> Mr. Concannon...?
5062,Amanda I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen. <BR> No Josh I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man. <BR> You know you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you nothing happened! <BR> Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold Josh. They're cold lying eyes. <BR> What? My eyes are not lying! <BR> Yes they are Josh. Since Mankato they have been lying eyes.
5063,The one that left you? <BR> That's right. That one.
5064,Hope I'm not interrupting...? <BR> What does he want?
5065,If you resign you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years. <BR> And if I stay?
5066,Birdie- <BR> Hmm? <BR> You don't like Eve do you? <BR> Do you want an argument or an answer? <BR> An answer. <BR> No. <BR> Why not? <BR> Now you want an argument. <BR> She works hard. <BR> Night an' day. <BR> She's loyal and efficient- <BR> Like an agent with one client. <BR> She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she? <BR> Well... let's say she thinks only about you anyway... <BR> How do you mean that?
5067,That means the nanobot is still inside him. <BR> Yes. <BR> What would happen if I threw him into the core? <BR> The same thing I suppose.
5068,It's a short life and a gay one... <BR> Every glass high to life -- the splendid dangerous mighty brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it.  Baron you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the -- 
5069,Caesar ignore them. <BR> Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better. <BR> At least stay for the running of the animals.  You are paying for it you know...
5070,I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep. <BR> You look ghastly Tom. Are you okay?
5071,The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth. <BR> You're wrong. <BR> You don't run as hard MacLeod. You just don't run as hard anymore.
5072,I won't have another mate like ONA.  You rate very high in sanitation.  I've checked.  In fact I am surprised that you were ever matched with LUH.  Her ratings are very erratic - you know what I mean.  We'll be happy. <BR> I don't feel well.
5073,There! You said it was boring. <BR> Well *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
5074,Actually it's not about work it's advice about -- <BR> Oh for crying out loud Ben you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now -- <BR> Well Elena and I have kind of been talking not really talking but -- <BR> -- Your mother God bless her stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought -- <BR> But dad you guys truly hated each other I mean really hated each -- <BR> -- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid you married that woman against my advice -- <BR> -- What advice? You never -- <BR> That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago and that's the truth and here it is 1972 -- <BR> -- 73 <BR> -- 73 and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket and for crying out loud Ben be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.
5075,Juno? Wow I didn't expect to see you here. <BR> I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here? <BR> No she's working late tonight. She's trying to accrue some extra time off for when you know...
5076,What's the matter? <BR> Casy! What you doin' here? <BR> Well if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya boy? <BR> Thought you was in jail. <BR> No I done my time an' got out. Come on in. 
5077,Fuck it!  He doesn't like me John!  It's your fault Henry. <BR> I beg your pardon -- <BR> It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover? <BR> He was he was.  We taught a class together at Harvard.  But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals they can't ... <BR> No Henry.  I don't. <BR> He's turned into a drug fiend he shot people from helicopters in Vietnam he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children.  He sees a shrink in L.A.  He's all fucked up. Now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... If he gets away with it everybody will follow his lead.  He must be stopped at all costs.
5078,These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus. <BR> Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which of course they do. <BR> You're wasting your time Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost. <BR> Perhaps.
5079,This is all cause of your mom Kyle. She's such a bitch-  AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie. <BR> And she's getting worse...
5080,You don't think I'll do it do you? <BR> I think you're fucking crazy! <BR> Where is it? <BR> Where's what? <BR> The money! <BR> Caesar I don't know what you're thinking here but if you don't put down that gun --
5081,Who we got here...? <BR> John Levy Staff and Amy Cain Press Off.... <BR> Alright.  Look here any of you kids hear in this room:  what you hear here what you say here what you <u>do</u> here f'it got out you leaked it.  Tell'em what they need to know. <BR> When it broke he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean. <BR> Well.  Alright.  What is it?  What's he uh...?  He had an Illegal Immigrant was his Gardener some years back...?  What's the thing?  You people get ahead you sure get nervous.
5082,More concerns than that? <BR> We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.
5083,Hold still. Why? <BR> You can't always tell what's going on there. <BR> ...No. Why was it. <BR> I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt. <BR> Could you do anything about it?
5084,I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight I suppose in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap erotic minds! <BR> Mother please... <BR> And then what? After supper music? Whispers? <BR> Mother she's just a stranger... hungry and the weather's bad... <BR> Mother she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers as if... oh I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand Boy? <BR> Go on go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her cause you don't have the guts? Huh boy? You have the guts boy? <BR> Shut up! Shut up!
5085,What do you want? <BR> What do you mean? <BR> You know what I mean.
5086,What? <BR> Did I get my package in the mail? <BR> I dunno. <BR> Whaddaya mean you don't know? <BR> I don't know! <BR> Oh no Hannah! <BR> What? <BR> Look!  Janie!
5087,I hate that little fuck!  I hate him!  I hate him!  I should've done him! <BR> But you know he did it. <BR> So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think! <BR> Caesar what are we going to do?
5088,I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now there'd be tears and laughter ... <BR> And the moral of that story is -- ? <BR> Go to them. They'll be happy to see you ... Ahhh...
5089,What's that? <BR> _Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming. <BR> So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate? <BR> Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything. <BR> How long will the effect last? <BR> About ten minutes. <BR> Ten minutes... <BR> If I give you a bigger dose it'll give you a heart attack.
5090,I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened... <BR> Not yet. <BR> Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works. <BR> Great. <BR> Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department. <BR> I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens. <BR> You're not going to be there? <BR> I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow.  They're... digging up some new evidence.
5091,Any word Kip -- ? <BR> No ... And they won't take my calls ... <BR> What does that mean -- ? <BR> 
5092,It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come I might not be standing here now. <BR> Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds? <BR> No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus. <BR> Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you. <BR> For once in my life I managed to keep my mouth shut. There's something to be said for that I suppose.
5093,B-3. <BR> Miss.  G-6. <BR> Ohhh!  You sunk it! <BR> Heh-heh. <BR> Are you peeking? <BR> Oh quit your whining and pay up.
5094,You're the guys from the movie! <BR> We hate you guys!
5095,All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it. <BR> So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
5096,I knew I should have driven. <BR> Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
5097,Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you... <BR> I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it. <BR> I hope you're right... <BR> ...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here and get the fuck gone.
5098,Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily. <BR> The Harkonnens are our enemies yes... but behind them I suspect is the Emperor. -- THUFIR You will make a formidable Duke!
5099,Where did this body go? <BR> I said someone came last night --  Look this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like -- <BR> Shit we didn't sign in. <BR> So get the hell out of here. <BR> Fine.  But I'd like to sign in.  In fact I insist on it.  Where's the book?  I gotta sign in -- 
5100,"Robert Cushman is a lieutenant general in the Marine Corps, the Deputy Director of the CIA ... and this is what you use him for? <BR> I didn't choose him as my deputy, Mr. President.  You did."
5101,What are you reading? <BR> Of Human Bondage. <BR> Somerset Maugham. <BR> Yeah it's pretty relevant considering my situation. <BR> You're not gonna start that again.
5102,What the fuck you think I wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? Yeah you're working. And put down the champagne. <BR> She poured it for -- <BR> Far as she knows you're John Gotti. Now put the shit down and act like you got some ass.
5103,Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way. <BR> The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said everything I need to catch him is right here in these pages... <BR> Lecter said a lot of things. <BR> He's here Ardelia.

5133,Oh yeah? <BR> You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office? <BR> Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something. <BR> Am I bothering you? <BR> No. You're not bothering me. You a senior? <BR> Yes. <BR> How is Central these days? <BR> Terrible. boring. <BR> What else is new?. right? <BR> Yeah. What are you doing now? <BR> I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital. <BR> That's too bad. <BR> What do you know about the ear?. anything? <BR> Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?  <BR> Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything? <BR> I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names. <BR> Do you know who was brought in for questioning? <BR> There were at least three maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others. <BR> Were all these people questioned this afternoon? <BR> No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts. <BR> The ear is from a missing person maybe? <BR> Maybe so. <BR> It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in? <BR> Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her. <BR> I guess you have to get back home soon? <BR> Not really why?  You want to see the building?. Come on I'll show you.
5134,What are you doing here? <BR> Mickey told me to come back to work.
5135,Micheal now is probably not the best time for this. <BR> No this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I as well as several others present have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed living in major denial locked down fly-boy butt-fucker.
5136,I'm not saying shit to neither of you. <BR> Why? What I say bad? <BR> What the fuck 'Red Dragon?' <BR> What? Why am I bad?
5137,...he's a good man... <BR> ...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case. <BR> ...I have to stand up for her... <BR> Frank but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back. <BR> I have to try this case. I have to do it Mick. I've got to stand up for that girl. I need your help.  Mick will you help me...?  Will you help me...?
5138,You gotta be kidding. <BR> Not at all just a pleasant way to have lunch.
5139,Yeah.   We just go home. <BR> We can't. <BR> I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the airport and get on a plane.
5140,You want coffee or something? <BR> Well maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen -- <BR> Look Elena the fact that we're neighbors... you know close friends well it sort of makes this a little strange don't you think? <BR> My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy and since you are standing here alone I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all.
5141,"Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone. <BR> Let's get some coffee and talk."
5142,We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye. <BR> You're going?  Well thanks again.  Good to see you Rachel...  Thanks for coming Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's uh... at the zoo.  Sorry. <BR> Happy Birthday Nicholas. <BR> I'll call.  I really will. <BR> I know.
5143,I been working on some stuff for you.  What'cha doing? <BR> I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me. <BR> Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need? <BR> A dress. <BR> Dress huh?  What for? <BR> For the dance. <BR> Come again? <BR> I'm going to the senior dance. <BR> Second word... sound like 'dance'.
5144,Okay Micheal let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy. <BR> How about my Fatburger? <BR> Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me? <BR> I love you.
5145,Larry I'm a businessman trying to make a buck like anybody else. <BR> So?  So? <BR> So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace plain and simple. <BR> Look what am I supposed to do? It's done it's over.  We have to deal with the consequences.
5146,Insubordination.  To the Emperor... and the Senate. <BR> Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your victory.  They will hear that you are living in luxury. He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life. And soon the army won't even remember your name.
5147,Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner. <BR> From your mouth ta God's ear. <BR> He's got a line on the good stuff.
5148,Don't think too badly of her... After all you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman. <BR> Get it over with...
5149,I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first. <BR> Just move!
5150,Uh... w-we're going back to the Pierre. We're staying at the Pierre... and we're gonna meet Jack and Angelica and have a drink there and... if you'd like to come uh we'd love to have you. <BR> Yeah. <BR> And we could just sit and talk... nothing. Uh not a big deal it's just relax just be very mellow.
5151,How curious ... <BR> Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
5152,I'm sorry? <BR> For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man? <BR> Uh -- both? <BR> Forget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you.
5153,Man don't go up there... <BR> One whistle... Start the engine...
5154,Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again. <BR> You ever think of getting a new car Wade? <BR> On what you pay me? <BR> Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car fix the clutch.
5155,You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition. <BR> Don't give me that. I know what's real goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
5156,So she was distraught that her husband was dead? <BR> Oh yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
5157,Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat? <BR> They must've hit something.
5158,We're going to the Halford's. The number's on the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around 11. <BR> Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party? <BR> I suppose. Why? <BR> Just curious. If there's a problem I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt. <BR> What sort of problems are you planning exactly?
5159,You had enough? <BR> Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.
5160,Right. <BR> Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me and I put it in the office safe which was crammed.
5161,Come on we're going to get your coat. <BR> Take your hands off me!
5162,Wait. Wait a minute. <BR> What? <BR> We can't do this. <BR> We've already done this. <BR> No I mean the suitcases. We can't bury them in suticases.
5163,Jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matinée. <BR> Tu sais oů me trouver.
5164,I can assure you... <BR> Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...
5165,I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple. <BR> Can't you see I'm praying goddammit?!
5166,She's in there! <BR> I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
5167,"We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have. <BR> I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems..."
5168,How are you? <BR> Head still secure to the neck. <BR> How did you find me? <BR> How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
5169,Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this! <BR> They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
5170,I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him? <BR> On the road. <BR> Now don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver! <BR> No. <BR> Who is he? <BR> I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him. <BR> Well if it's as serious as all thatwe'll move heaven and earth to <BR> It'll do no good.  He despises me. <BR> Oh come now <BR> He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered and selfish and thoroughly insincere. <BR> Ridiculous! <BR> He doesn't think so much of you either. <BR> Well! <BR> He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly. <BR> Fine man to fall in love with. <BR> He's marvelous! <BR> Well what are we going to do about it? Where is he? <BR> I don't know. <BR> I'd like to have a talk with him. <BR> It's no use Dad. I practically threw myself at him.  <BR> Well under the circumstances don't you think we ought to call this thing off? <BR> No I'll go through with it. <BR> But that's silly child. Seeing how you feel why <BR> It doesn't matter.  I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to youmade your life so miserableand mine too. I'm tired Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
5171,That's not all Lieutenant.  Wait until you see the tape.  It's unbelievable. <BR> I'd like you to see this.
5172,If you had half the brains you're supposed to have you'd have done it yourselflong ago. <BR> Do you love her? <BR> A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing! <BR> I asked you a question. Do you love her? <BR> Yes!  But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself.
5173,Do you want a drink? <BR> Yeah a drink. 'Civilized' right? <BR> Alfred bring something for Mr. Knox -- I'll have one too.
5174,Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball. <BR> Okay Dennis.
5175,Hey. What are you guys doing here? <BR> We're springing you Leer. Get some pants on.
5176,I am Raymond.     Thank you for allowing us to stay here. <BR> No problem man.  Hey you wanna hit? <BR> No thank you.
5177,Heh heh heh. <BR> You said it would be unethical to help me. You call dwarf bowling ethical!
5178,That's what we need here Satch.  A lucky break. <BR> That wasn't luck Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job.
5179,You know a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped. <BR> Hell of a way to die. <BR> It wasn't always fatal Wesley. We could scalp Del right now and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels.
5180,I gotta tell ya Wade I'm leanin' to Jerry's viewpoint here. <BR> Well - <BR> We gotta protect Jean. These - we're not holdin' any cards here Wade they got all of 'em. So they call the shots.
5181,Let me know if you need anything okay? <BR> Are you and Larry happy? <BR> Oh I dunno... enough I s'pose. <BR> Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good even if it's only a little bit. <BR> All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are? <BR> All the time... <BR> Well you are.
5182,A recent acquisition. Weve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen computers wrecked faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flats been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back. <BR> Hah... What about Nathalie? <BR> No answer. You have no passport and your Embassys out. How do you plan to leave the U.S. Mr Lombard? <BR> Im sure Ill find a way. <BR> Like youll find a way to stop your Austrian killing you a second time round?
5183,Kathy Price... <BR> Yes... <BR> You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth nineteen seventy-six the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted... <BR> Yes.
5184,Mmm.  Same schedule's okay. <BR> Alright! <BR> Can you handle it? <BR> It's not brain surgery Chuck.
5185,What are you doing... ? <BR> Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
5186,Whaddya got whaddya got? <BR> Hunt is Colson's man--  --that's Charles Colson Nixon's special counsel--  --they both went to Brown University--  --Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70 and this is on deep background the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in.
5187,Ain't you gonna see what it is Homer? <BR> Mind your own business Peaches. <BR> Sorry Homer...
5188,So you're saying it wasn't like that at all. <BR> Not exactly. I mean there was more to it than I told you. <BR> Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up. <BR> Yeah I picked it up. <BR> And started to run. <BR> And started to run. <BR> Good thinking. <BR> That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it. <BR> You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble don't you?  So how much does it come to? <BR> Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars to be exact. <BR> So you robbed the robbers and now the robbers are after you. <BR> That's it. In a nutshell. <BR> Yeah well you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry. <BR> No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now. <BR> A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you. <BR> That money is my whole future. <BR> Keep up with that attitude and you won't have a future.  Seventeen is a hell of an age to die. Is that what you want?
5189, <BR> It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
5190,Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente. <BR> Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge maybe they can bust the strike.
5191,This woman's an institution. <BR> I don't care what she is. She's an institution that's the problem. She's lazy.
5192,I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this. <BR> John he's got my driver's license. <BR> What? <BR> He took my driver's license John he knows where we live. <BR> He took your wallet? <BR> No he tossed the wallet but he kept the license. <BR> He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet? <BR> In my pocket. <BR> We got him!  Dad you got him! <BR> What? <BR> His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet. <BR> How the hell am I gonna do that? <BR> Listen to me very carefully take your wallet out just touch it on the corners. <BR> What... <BR> Please Dad just do it. <BR> Okay okay...
5193,Fuck this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry. <BR> It's all right sir.
5194,So how'd you like LION KING? <BR> Oh I loved it.  I wish you'd gone. <BR> I know.  I'm sorry.  Work. <BR> You work too hard John. <BR> Look who's talking.
5195,"Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him! <BR> That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper. <BR> Sure he is."
5196,It's like Samuel Beckett you know- I admire the technique but he doesn't... he doesn't hit me on a gut level. <BR> I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level.
5197,Am I supposed to feel happy now? <BR> You should be happy Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet screaming pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in... <BR> Viscera? <BR> Blood and guts. <BR> We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.
5198,Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never. <BR> Okay. <BR> Did you hide the letters? <BR> Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room. <BR> I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me. <BR> Why? <BR> Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house. <BR> You'd do that for me? <BR> Of course I would. We're friends right? <BR> Best friends.
5199,Do you sail? <BR> Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you Alfred.
5200,We still have to get out of here. <BR> Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
5201,Jesus Christ. This is all I need. <BR> You told me you wanted to meet him. Wellhere he is.
5202,I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here. <BR> You really ought to look at this Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school. <BR> Why don't you put your mother's secret book back?
5203,Do you know where they're taking him? <BR> Yeah Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.
5204,This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made all the envy fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why. <BR> Because God loves a winner. <BR> He used to love losers. But the laws of physics changed.
5205,I have samples all over the kitchen.  <BR> Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
5206,I'll be damned. <BR> Did you see him?  Do you know who he is? <BR> No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em. <BR> It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work. <BR> Whatta we do now? <BR> Sissy Clark 190 Riverside Dr. apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment between two thirty and five.
5207,Kill him!  Tribuus -- execute that bastard. <BR> You can't do that!  You came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you.
5208,Later. But first -- him. <BR> David? <BR> Exactly. Now I've been thinking -- <BR> Oh good. <BR> He won't do anything for me but for you -- <BR> Forget it. <BR> He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him you'd use your influence to get him down then he'd be safe. <BR> And the money? <BR> We could put it somewhere. <BR> Where he can't get it? <BR> Now you thought of that not me. <BR> Forget it -- he'll come down.
5209,So what'd the other guy look like? <BR> Never saw him was your basic hit and run. <BR> But you look like you been in a train wreck how'd he just drive away?
5210,A matter of opinion. Granted. It is also true that you worked in a brewery. But life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it. As a matter of fact it got less and less dull - until you boss's wife had your boss followed by detectives! <BR> She never proved anything not a thing! <BR> But the $500 you got to get out of town brought you straight to New York - didn't it?
5211,Maybe she needs help Ted. You should be a gentleman. <BR> I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
5212,How'd they describe her? <BR> You know blonde thin whatever... <BR> Not so fast! Slower... 'blonde thin' yes... Did they say she had style? A kind of grace or anything?
5213,What am I doing here?  Why I'm here to see my partners Gregor the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together. <BR> But you hate each other! <BR> What's a little hate between business partners?
5214,I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad. <BR> He'll be all right. <BR> Too bad. He called me up today can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him. <BR> It'll be a while before he's up and running again. <BR> OK last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it. <BR> No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap. <BR> I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up. <BR> Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal some pizza? <BR> No we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough. <BR> No the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
5215,You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night girl! <BR> I ain't your business no more Daddy. Please let me go.
5216,Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind. <BR>  <BR> The police Department at Merritsville. They called to report. The trunk was just picked up -- by Mrs. Anna Thorwald.
5217,Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck. <BR> Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you. <BR> Go home! <BR> You go home!
5218,What did they say? <BR> Uh... they said... they will think about it. <BR> Good. <BR> But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.
5219,We certainly did. <BR> We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--
5220,Whatever the reason Im sorry I did. Goodbye Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out. <BR> You knew he had nothing to do with your brothers disappearance didnt you? <BR> Huh! Dont you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it. <BR> I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being... <BR> How... When did you... <BR> It must be tough being married to Adonis to end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. Whats harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or imagining what he does with his children?
5221,I had a family once -- a wife three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening -- <BR> He killed them? <BR> Eventually. He toyed with them first. He made me choose do you understand? Which order they would die in --
5222,Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom? <BR> If you set me free I will find my way back to the army march on Rome and depose you.  Then the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.
5223,Take care of yourself out there... <BR> I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand... <BR> Bill... <BR> Huh? <BR> Don't get stuck on some glamour puss- <BR> I'll try. <BR> You're not such a bargain you know conceited and thoughtless and messy- <BR> Everybody can't be Gregory Peck. <BR> - you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe. <BR> How childish are you going to get before you quit it? <BR> I don't want to be childish I'd settle for just a few years- <BR> And cut that out right now. <BR> Am I going to lose you Bill? Am I? <BR> As of this moment you're six years old...
5224,Well Rick you're not only a sentimentalist but you've become a patriot. <BR> Maybe but it seemed like a good time to start. <BR> I think perhaps you're right.
5225,Listen to me you thankless little prick.  We're your parents so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. What the hell is it this captain? Because I'll see him in a rowboat... <BR> It has nothing to do with him. <BR> Well what does it have to do with? Us? <BR> No.  Look it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once?
5226,"Time, Pilch! My move. <BR> No fair! You lured him with produce."
5227,Papa can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ... <BR> The what! <BR> The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help. <BR> Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school? <BR> But Papa -- you need all the help you can get. <BR> You've got to help around the house! <BR> But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ... <BR> You should have helped her without being asked.
5228,What's that supposed to prove? <BR> Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
5229,"If they harass you, I, too, will resign.  And I will tell the world why. <BR> Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry. <BR> You have many friends ... and admirers ... <BR> Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being? <BR> Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees? <BR> Yes.  My mother used to pray ... a lot.  It's been a long time since I really prayed.  Let's pray, Henry; let's pray a little."
5230,Oh my God!  What is that?!  Why you showing me this shit!?  JESUS!  JESUS! Get those away from me! <BR> Nicky Moore.  Patty Ryan.  Mary Finelli. These names mean anything to you asshole?  Julia Sullivan!  She mean anything?  She means something to me!
5231,How did you get in here? You're under age. <BR> I came with Captain Renault. <BR> I should have known. <BR> My husband is with me too. <BR> He is? Well Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?
5232,My mistake. I apologize. <BR> What made you ask such a question? <BR> I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions. <BR> I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to uh... interpret or something. <BR> I already apologized.
5233,This is Flynn... the one who busted me out. <BR> Then I owe you some thanks...
5234,Stop it Alvy! <BR> Well he's spitting on my neck! You know he's spitting on my neck when he talks.
5235,Micheal? Do you have something to tell me? <BR> Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing... <BR> Shut up Boyd! Micheal?
5236,Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten two-fifteen -- <BR> Bullshit. <BR> -- Well maybe two-seventeen. <BR> You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track? <BR> No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees man. To the leaves. To this sand you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth. <BR> Is that right? Well listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area. <BR> No this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long. <BR> You've got no jurisdiction. <BR> You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter. <BR> Maybe you're not aware of this Crow Horse but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods psycholingusitics DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here. <BR> Go back to the M.E. take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is -- <BR> -- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota. <BR> I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs. <BR> His spiritual mother... <BR> To us Indians our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them. <BR> Thank God. Now listen to me asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security. <BR> Easy. Easy... I'm goin'.
5237,Easy for you to say. <BR> What's that supposed to mean?! <BR> Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat. <BR> I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that! <BR> That's not what Skipper thought.  He was trying to spill air from the main!
5238,Hi I'm Sueleen Gay. <BR> I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine. <BR> Oh why thank you. <BR> May I see your costume?
5239,What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something. <BR> You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you? <BR> No.   Chicks dig me.
5240,Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country. It's the one job basically any woman can get and make a living on. The reason is because of tips. <BR> Fuck all that.
5241,I had a really nice time tonight. <BR> Me too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
5242,Is something wrong? <BR> I want to know if my sister is here. <BR> Here? <BR> With you. <BR> Where? <BR> I don't know where. In your store somewhere in your town... anywhere. <BR> What's the matter? <BR> Don't you know?
5243,I am afraid not. My regrets Monsieur. <BR> Well perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
5244,Well that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town? <BR> There's a pizza place over on Market. <BR> Cute waitresses? <BR> That's open to debate. <BR> I'll take my chances. Come on I'm buying.
5245,Where's Burke? <BR> Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.
5246,Where's Johnny? <BR> I tucked him in at Gordo's. <BR> You give him his drops? <BR> One in each ear.  What would you do without me? <BR> Probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work...
5247,I knew his great-grandfather. <BR> You're insane. <BR> No seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon. <BR> How do you do it Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long? <BR> Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time. <BR> I've had a few more concerns.
5248,"She called you 'George,' George. <BR> ...did I win some contest?"
5249,Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT?? <BR> Well - yeah - but that doesn't...<u>apply</u>. It was different then. I was <u>depressed</u>. My life is great now. I'm in love!
5250,Anything other than the obvious bothering you? <BR> Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough. <BR> Hasn't been another call has there?
5251,Aramis... is this the way to hell? <BR> Hell may be our destination dear Porthos but not this trip.
5252,Now where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo? <BR> I told you...
5253,I'm yours. <BR> Y'know Annie I been thinking if it works for one game maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games. <BR> Breathing through your pingala always works honey-- <BR> Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile. <BR> Now don't go overboard I look incredibly hot right?
5254,I was just curious--you don't do it well so I wondered. Have you been threatened if you told the truth is that it? <BR> ...No... never in so many words... <BR> It's obvious you want to talk to someone--well I'm someone.
5255,And you Sven aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard? <BR> I will join my grandfather there.
5256,Well? <BR> You have changed since second grade. <BR> I mean what do you think? <BR> You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain. <BR> Oh Teddy Bear you're funny.
5257,We're doing all right Dad.  We're doing good. <BR> Tell me. <BR> It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before. <BR> I'm glad.
5258,For Christ's sake it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth! <BR> But sir we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...
5259,Now wait a minute Dad... <BR> Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through we all gain.
5260,How did you come to Gateway? <BR> They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
5261,Yes. <BR> I have to change and take a shower first. If you want to come home and wait.
5262,Aramis this will never -- <BR> Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance. <BR> But -- <BR> It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready but so are his guards!
5263,"A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me? <BR> Not really, no. <BR> Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders."
5264,You're all certifiable you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on Tim let's go outside. <BR> Jeez Mom stop trippin'.
5265,Do not turn your back on me. <BR> You are really going to force this aren't you? <BR> Either you are with me or against me.
5266,Any change? <BR> I hit a few... uh games on the way back. <BR> That was all bullshit. She just pocketed the cash.
5267,When ya got all that blood workin' in your belly it ain't upstairs where it needs to be. <BR> The kid just called me stupid. <BR> Not stupid. Fat. <BR> Shit. When I was comin' up bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you people felt sorry for 'em. Right Gerardo?
5268,Three... Rudy got ambitious. <BR> And you got him... <BR> That's right.
5269,Nobody's fuckin talking to you. <BR> And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging? <BR> I got news for you Horrace got his ass out of there before you did. <BR> Bullshit. <BR> What? You don't think Horrace would leave your white ass in there to hang?
5270,Who was it? <BR> I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
5271,Well I was in be- It's three o'clock in the morning. You uh you got me outta bed I ran over here I couldn't get a taxi cab. You said it was an emergency and I didn't ge- I ran up the stairs. Hell - I was a lot more attractive when the evening began. Look uh tell- Whatta you- Are you going with a right-wing rock-and- roll star? Is that possible? <BR> Would you like a glass of chocolate milk? <BR> Hey what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to -- <BR> I got the good chocolate Alvy. <BR> Yeah where is the spider? <BR> It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom. <BR> Is he in the bathroom? <BR> Hey don't squish it and after it's dead flush it down the toilet okay? And flush it a couple o' times. <BR> Darling darling I've been killing spiders since I was thirty okay? <BR> Oh. What? <BR> Very big spider. <BR> Yeah? <BR> Two... Yeah. Lotta lotta trouble. There's two of 'em.
5272,I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want. <BR> I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything. <BR> You sure? <BR> Oh I'll be fine.  Got my chair got my window I'm great. <BR> Mmkay.
5273,Whoever hired us. <BR> I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring only that they were paying a lot of money...
5274,I passed out. <BR> You did. <BR> I've been doing that a lot lately. <BR> So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana I understand. <BR> Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells? <BR> How long have you been having them? <BR> The last month maybe. <BR> How long have you been smoking marijuana? <BR> Spiro T. Agnew was vice president I believe. <BR> That's probably not the problem then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently? <BR> I've been trying to finish a book... <BR> And your wife left you. <BR> Is that in my chart? <BR> I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did.
5275,M'lady... if anyone sees it is death... <BR> If I don't kiss you I die anyway. <BR> I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong? <BR> Nothing... Nothing.
5276,Oh. <BR> It was a wonderful set. <BR> Oh gosh. <BR> I really enjoyed it.  Nice to have metcha. Good night.
5277,....I'm taking SP5 but it doesn't seem strong enough.  I have a hard time concentrating.  Please forgive me I slipped on.... <BR> You are a true believer.  Blessings of the state blessings of the masses.  Thou art a subject of the divine.  Created in the image of man by the masses for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  Work hard; increase production; prevent accidents and be happy.
5278,Oh God... <BR> But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.
5279,I'm not here very much. <BR> Business keeps you on the road? <BR> Something like that.
5280,Yep. <BR> But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?! <BR> Yeah it's the biggest disappointment!
5281,Hey we came here to observe you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality all you care about is what you can take. <BR> None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff and I'm guessing by the look on his face --
5282,I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice isn't it? <BR> It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
5283,It will take less effort as you learn. <BR> It's like to kill me first.
5284,Is that a school? <BR> K through sixth. <BR> Doesn't it get noisy? <BR> I like the noise. <BR> My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking. <BR> You must hate it. <BR> I go backpacking a lot. Lose myself in the wilderness for a week or two.
5285,She's not my bride she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here. <BR> That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her? <BR> She dropped in on me... holding this.
5286,No more bad luck now!  The people are anticipating you!  I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman!  The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome! <BR> Make us rich Proximo make us very rich...
5287,"Then stop being a star - start treating your guests as your supporting cast! <BR> Hear, hear..."
5288,To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life. <BR> To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight. <BR> I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back. <BR> That's good. <BR> I've got plans! <BR> Ripley's plans. <BR> Esatto. I'm always planning. <BR> Did I know you at Princeton Tom? I didn't did I? <BR> Why are you asking all of a sudden? <BR> No reason. Because you're leaving I guess. I don't think you were there were you? <BR> Why? <BR> I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example. <BR> Then I'll take it as a compliment. <BR> I knew it! I had a bet with Marge! <BR> Ha. <BR> Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit? <BR> I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to like everything about the way you live. It's one big love affair. If you knew my life back home in New York...
5289,...the Albanian Campaign.  And we won't even be a footnote... <BR> We <u>were</u> the Albanian campaign John -- <u>We Were There</u>.
5290,Behold the sword of power Excalibur. Before Uther it belonged to Lud before Lud to Beowulf before Beowulf to Baldur the Good before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow.  Speak the words. <BR> One land one king! That is my peace!
5291,"You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him. <BR> You need not kill a man to destroy him. <BR> No, you need only take away what is most precious to him."
5292,Which way's out man -- ? <BR> Shit all looks the same here --
5293,Addison won't it be just perfect? Lloyd and I - there's no telling how far we can go... he'll write great plays for me I'll make them be great!  You're the only one I've told the only one that knows except Lloyd and me... <BR> ... and Karen. <BR> She doesn't know.
5294,Jeanne...!  Are you alright? <BR> Yes.  Yes I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that? <BR> Because there's an arrow in your leg.
5295,He's busting the shaft! Start the pump! <BR> Where...? <BR> The bilge pumps. There --
5296,What happened? <BR> _Krueger_... <BR> Who? <BR> Come on.
5297,Hello hotshot! <BR> Hey baby! Where are you? <BR> At the store. You doin' some good? <BR> None you'd notice. I'm lonely... <BR> Me too. And very erotic... <BR> Tell me about yourself. <BR> Which part? That or the day-to-day. <BR> Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin? <BR> Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing. <BR> Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it... <BR> Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home I just wondered. <BR> I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon. <BR> To do what? <BR> I have to see somebody.
5298,But I want you to know that I understand why you're afraid--a lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid. I'm really sorry for what you're being put through. <BR> All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff? <BR> We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax. <BR> I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
5299,Yes Mr. Lowery. <BR> Caroline...? Mary still isn't in? <BR> No Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings. <BR> Buzz me the minute she comes in.
5300,What? I'm not made of stone. <BR> Well there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
5301,I passed out but I'm okay. <BR> At least you're safe.  What about the others?
5302,What is it? <BR> President's speech. <BR> At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat wet Albanian Broad we... <BR> No no no no no <u>after</u> the airport.
5303,Well. If I didn't come to see the play I wouldn't have anywhere else to go. <BR> There are other plays... <BR> Not with you in them. Not by Mr. Richards...
5304,"Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time. <BR> Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately. <BR> I guess I do too. <BR> You what? <BR> I sometimes fade out. <BR> Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them. <BR> You were going to get my door."
5305,Fifty. <BR> Fifty? We need seventy-five. <BR> Ken we've been through this...
5306,Come again? <BR> Yeah got dead drunk passed out in the bottom of the riverbed. <BR> The L.A. River? <BR> Yeah under Hollenbeck Bridge what's wrong with that?
5307,...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years? This is a... why? Why would you do that? <BR> I thought I would need it. <BR> And why please tell us would you think that? <BR> After after the operation when that poor girl she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired and he never looked at the admittance form.  And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine.  Or else or else he said...  He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again... Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse...
5308,Help cook? <BR> Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet ya know. <BR> Okay.
5309,You see if a phone's tapped the Feds can only listen in... <BR> ...on the stuff involving crimes. So on... <BR> ...routine calls they have to click off after a few minutes. <BR> Yeah and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
5310,I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here -- <BR> Don't I always?
5311,This must be the last straw. <BR> Here's the one that broke the camel's back. <BR> Someone didn't want us to get to the party. <BR> I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
5312,Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m. <BR> What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables? <BR> I can't help it  it sticks in my mind.
5313,Let's forget who said what to whom... <BR> You got a deal...
5314,So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates? <BR> Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants. <BR> Unfortunately what he wants is you. <BR> So what about you? <BR> Do I want you? <BR> We'll get into that later.
5315,All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars. <BR> Yeah but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas. <BR> Listen manI'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say? <BR> ain't got a hat <BR> What? <BR> I ain't got a hat. <BR> Well you got one now. Come on fill 'er up.
5316,Yeah from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over. <BR> You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million. <BR> If you get it back in one piece. <BR> It's a risk I'm willing to take.
5317,Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know like Moses in the reeds. <BR> Technically that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
5318,Are you serious? <BR> Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons fatalities evidence of a large predator.... <BR> No one has seen a shark -- no fin no bites nothing.  Be realistic. <BR> I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that can't you? <BR> Of course I can but can't it wait? These things cost money and this town doesn't have much money. <BR> We have to do something. <BR> We have done something -- hell we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles y'know. <BR> I know I know.... <BR> And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one. <BR> It's still a good idea. <BR> Martin when we build up our tax base a little you can have every- thing you want; right now the town's broke. <BR> Please Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers.... <BR> A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites no sharks nothing but a boating accident. <BR> Two of them are still missing! <BR> There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up.  Are they all shark victims? <BR> Maybe they are!
5319,They know.  They've been watching us.  I can feel it. <BR> They don't know. <BR> They're watching us now. <BR> No one can see us now we're alone.
5320, <BR> 'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-
5321,Mick. Mick. Mick... <BR> What? <BR> You -- Listen: you said to me 'if not now when...' <BR> I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?
5322, <BR> Collision? With what? <BR> The page's missing. Then their SOS was real. <BR> But where's the damage? <BR> Maybe the other ship took the worst of it. <BR> If it was a ship she hit.
5323,Monsieur Rick what kind of man is Captain Renault? <BR> Oh he's just like any other man only more so. <BR> No I mean is he trustworthy? Is his word -- <BR> -- Now just a minute. Who told you to ask me that? <BR> He did. Captain Renault did. <BR> I thought so. Where's your husband? <BR> At the roulette table trying to win enough for our exit visa. Well of course he's losing.
5324,What works? <BR> Phone security systems everything works.  You ask for it we got it!
5325,But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey! <BR> Forget it. I don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old.  Can I offer you a ride somewhere?
5326,They've got lives to be grateful for. <BR> William you're not making sense. <BR> [Beat] They're at Church. And I bet that's where Becker is.
5327,We're not even sure what it was. <BR> What else could've done that?
5328,Do you think you can steer this thing? <BR> Sure. <BR> Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks. <BR> What are you doing? <BR> Marge-maintenance. <BR> Aye aye.
5329,What tunnel? Where? <BR> It's in the basement about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there. <BR> What's it for?
5330,What? <BR> What'd I say? <BR> That you were fired. <BR> Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that. <BR> Because of today?  The beach? <BR> No sweat.  A blessing in disguise. Back to the city you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here you realize that?  Me surrounded by water...Ridiculous. <BR> Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened! <BR> Showed them the photo showed them the goddamn Shark big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there somewhere... I shot off my gun shot off my big mouth so they fired me.... <BR> Honey this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they.... <BR> ...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass.... <BR> They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years you've protected this town the people on this island.... <BR> Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw.... <BR> I know you did.... <BR> I try.  Goddamnit I tried...Now I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm....
5331,Yes. <BR> She tried everything to get them and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me but that was all over long ago. For your sake she pretended it wasn't and I let her pretend.
5332,Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow. <BR> Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth? <BR> It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold - <BR> How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line - <BR> You're right Joe. <BR> Of course I am. <BR> First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account. <BR> No we're not. <BR> We're not? <BR> First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning. <BR> You're going to bet my money on a dog? <BR> He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit - <BR> What are you giving me with the rabbit? <BR> Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins we can pay everybody. <BR> But suppose he loses? <BR> What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time. <BR> But suppose it doesn't? <BR> Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?
5333,Stop it. I'm sorry. <BR> You know how important this is to my mother. You know that. <BR> I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else. <BR> I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks. <BR> Are we going to do this again? <BR> I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes. <BR> I wouldn't know. <BR> It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas. <BR> They organized this not me. I have nothing to do with it. <BR> Well it's bad timing. <BR> How do you figure? <BR> Right before the wedding? <BR> It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding. <BR> I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this. <BR> He is. <BR> He's a moron. <BR> He's my friend. He's not a moron. <BR> David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
5334,Come on man. Not with the owners here. <BR> Hey baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah I'll probably cut out early...
5335,Angelo!  Don't fire! <BR> Kid get outta the way!! <BR> NOOO!!
5336,We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and-- <BR> Professor Barnhardt. <BR> Yeah sure. Mom do I have to go to school tomorrow? <BR> Of course dear. <BR> Aw gee Mom -- I had plans to play with Mr. Carpenter.
5337,Doesn't it worry you? <BR> No it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.
5338,My King I couldn't do it. Excalibur cannot be lost. Other men-- <BR> --By itself it is only a piece of steel. Its power comes from he who wields it. For now there is no one. Do as I have ordered!
5339,Interesting bloodline you have Ray.  French Scots-Irish Italian ...and one-eighth American Indian. <BR> Sioux Indian right?
5340,"Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches. <BR> I do. I'm -- are you...? <BR> I... I think I am... <BR> You know Elena, I've been thinking-- <BR> Ben, maybe no talking right now? If you start talking, you're going to--"
5341,Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston? <BR> The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that? <BR> She's my daughter Tom. <BR> So? <BR> So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex. <BR> Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
5342,Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention. <BR> Merry Christmas Sheriff.
5343,We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations. <BR> Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State? <BR> Believe me you don't understand. They wouldn't sit down at the same table.
5344,I think that's about the time I fell asleep. <BR> Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
5345," <BR> There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard. <BR> You're not listening to me. <BR>  <BR> What did you have in mind a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest? <BR> I was thinking a graphic designer mid-thirties and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular. <BR> All right, how about this one? Healthy educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."""""" <BR> Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids! <BR> Hey, Juno. Juno! Look at this one."
5346,Welcome to the club. <BR> Excuse me? <BR> I hear youre looking for Leon.  That makes me his old-lady and now you looking for the little bastard. Leons gone man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs? <BR> Uh-huh. <BR> No shit... Well Im afraid I cant help you. <BR> I take it you dont know where he is then? <BR> Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You dont know Leon do you? <BR> I know his work better than I know him. <BR> Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same man one and the same. At best fucking weird at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just aint worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of em. <BR> What about his girlfriend? <BR> What about which girlfriend? <BR> Small blond good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent. <BR> Oh. Thatd be Rhian a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago... <BR> Would you know where I might reach her? <BR> Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I dont really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends sell old furniture at Camden. Thats how come he only laid her at weekends ha ha... <BR> Could that be Camden Market? <BR> Yeah. Why? Youre going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good? <BR> Fucked-up fucking weird.
5347,Hi Spats.  We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show. <BR> Why wouldn't I? <BR> We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie. <BR> Well we all got to go sometime. <BR> Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms. <BR> What for? <BR> Orders from Little Bonaparte.
5348,Who is he Aramis? <BR> Tomorrow. <BR> Tonight!  Right now!  We steal a man from a royal prison we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide and still you wish to tell me nothing?! <BR> You seek facts when it would be better to seek truth. <BR> You are not my priest Aramis!  You would not be even if I had one. <BR> You are bitter Athos.  You are torn by grief not only for Raoul but for d'Artagnan whom you love and now treat as an enemy. <BR> He who is not with us is against us. <BR> Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets and I will never believe he is my enemy. <BR> Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?! <BR> There is that of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.
5349,See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen... <BR> ...I can't even see it... <BR> ...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old electronics freak got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today. <BR> Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell... <BR> Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office. <BR> No sir that would've been illegal... <BR> Sure...relax sport no one's gonna blow a whistle. Here is this legal?...you wanna put it in my account?
5350,What's the matter? <BR> I don't know I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy Max. <BR> Well sit down. <BR> Oh Jesus. <BR> You all right? <BR> I don't know I mean I- <BR> You wanna lie down? <BR> No no-my you know my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting... <BR> How about a ginger ale? <BR> Oh Max... no I maybe I better lie down.
5351,I'm sorry she hung up. What are -- <BR> Finding out where she is. <BR> How can you do that if she's already off the line? <BR> I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.
5352,You mind if I ride with you? <BR> Yeah stick around you might learn something.
5353,You don't want to know. <BR> You called Caitlin again? <BR> She called me. <BR> Did you tell Veronica? <BR> One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach thanks. <BR> What do you two fight about? <BR> I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here go back to school get some direction. <BR> I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree. <BR> You win. <BR> I'm going to offer you some advice my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now? <BR> Seven months. <BR> Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin? <BR> Five years. <BR> Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times? <BR> Eight and a half. <BR> Eight and a half? <BR> Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me. <BR> That's cheating? <BR> In the middle of it she calls me Brad. <BR> She called you Brad? <BR> She called me Brad. <BR>  <BR> I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson. <BR> What do you mean? <BR> She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party. <BR> Oh my God. <BR> Great story isn't it? <BR> That girl was vile to you. <BR> Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom? <BR> Your mother. <BR> Allan Harris. <BR> Chess team Allan Harris?! <BR> The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep. <BR> That's frightening. <BR> It takes different strokes to move the world. <BR> In light of this lurid tale I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles. <BR> Because there was a lot of good in our relationship. <BR> Oh yeah. <BR> I'm serious. Aside from the cheating we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra bad lunch and infidelity. <BR> You think things would be any different now? <BR> They are. When she calls me now she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone. <BR> Oh shit I've got to place an order. <BR> I'm talking to myself here. <BR> No no I'm listening. She's leaving college and...? <BR> ...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level. <BR> What about Veronica? <BR> I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin. <BR> Caitlin's on the same wave-length? <BR> I think it's safe to say yes. <BR> Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over. <BR> All four? <BR> You Veronica Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fiancé.
5354,Cheery looking bunch. <BR> Better living through electricity.
5355,Guys ready to order? <BR> Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables. <BR> Elliot? <BR> This is a great young out-of-work actress. <BR> Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
5356,I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy? <BR> That's where we came out. <BR> It's a lot of money Pam. <BR> We're talking raw unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop. <BR> Still... <BR> For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects it's a bargain at ten times the price.
5357,Maybe Connie went to get some books to study up with. He's gonna be a radio expert ya know. Maybe he figgered to suprise us. <BR> Maybe that's jus' what he done.
5358,I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked! <BR> Me too...
5359,Right after the Kids went out? <BR> What Kids?  Who went out? <BR> All of them.  Mike Junior Vaughn Brookie Peters Pat Lucy -- all that whole gang. <BR> Mike?  Our Mike? <BR> Yep.  Looked like they were headed to the lighthouse.
5360,Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his? <BR> I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on.
5361,He's blunt but he's got a point. <BR> At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
5362,Buzz Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you. <BR> Are you guys bruddas?
5363,She's been bitten. <BR> You should've killed her then. <BR> She hasn't turned yet.  You can help her.
5364,What? When? When did all this shit happen? <BR> Hey man that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.
5365,I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there Sam. <BR> Neither will I.
5366,Of course he did for God's sake.  Didn't he Mr. Pritchett? <BR> I can't comment until I get paid.
5367,I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and... <BR> Maybe if I just explain what happened I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
5368,So there you are. It seemed odd suddenly your not being there... <BR> Why should you think I wouldn't be? <BR> Why should you be? After all six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater- <BR> I hope you don't mind my speaking to you... <BR> Not at all. <BR> I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise- <BR> To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity... <BR> You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like? <BR> Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director. <BR> He's the best. <BR> He'll agree with you. Tell me what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait? <BR> Oh no. I see the play. <BR> You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive? <BR> Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage.
5369,The New Caledonia.  That's the name of it.  The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.  But tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us. <BR> Just the two of you?  What about the crew? <BR> Oh that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records - <BR> That's good thinking.  Daphne's a push-over for him.
5370,Who is he get his name? I'll kill him. <BR> Take it easy take it easy it was an accident. <BR> An accident?
5371,Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck. <BR> Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler? <BR> Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices? <BR> I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
5372,My father just took me on a trip to Australia. <BR> How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
5373,Dr. Lecktor will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside. <BR> I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him. <BR> As long as it's on soft paper.  You may...  Find this curious.
5374,Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo? <BR> He's being thorough that's all. I'm learning about my son Tom now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that about Mongibello. <BR> I'll try my best sir. Obviously I'll do anything to help Dickie.
5375,"Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do? <BR> Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million."
5376,"I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland. <BR> No need to involve outsiders in our business, Martin."
5377,Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot. <BR> Take me. Let the boy go. <BR> Gosh I could kill you but then you'd miss my party. And you Batman -- you're the guest of honor! <BR> What are you talking about? <BR> Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all...  ... You made me what I am today.
5378,I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here I'm just doubting that you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you'd unload this place... <BR> This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy. <BR> And now that your mother's dead?
5379,What are you looking for? <BR> Maybe there are notes or drawings of this place showing how those plates work.
5380,Your brother stumbled upon Adoniss little secret didnt he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it bought him his kid sent him away and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didnt come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kids life. Your flunkey let him in so his visit couldnt be concealed hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember Deborah? Leon does his own prints. Wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his Art.  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps its the way you say them... <BR> If-if my car is there I could be the one who... Why dont you accuse me of killing my brother? <BR> Kids are not your thing Deborah. Youd have been ready for me when I turned up with Sleeping Beauty. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. Not Leon you said. It struck me at the time but obviously not hard enough. You didnt say My God! or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. Not Leon. Who then?  You sure were right about one thing Deborah the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman Id stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at Ł15000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that didnt you? <BR> Leon could still have hung himself. <BR> Oh no. At long last Leon had found a mission. Hed never have killed himself when glory beckoned. Your husband killed your brother. And thanks to you almost got me killed too.
5381,Ever done this before? <BR> Once. <BR> Pure adrenalin right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump. <BR> Sure it's a blast but listen I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday-- <BR> Yeah I noticed you limping.  But don't worry about it brah. Don't worry at all.  We're not gonna land on land!
5382,I'm sure if our departments cooperate we can find out the truth. <BR> Cooperate? <BR> Every step of the way. <BR> If you guys want in fine.  Just remember this is our jurisdiction.
5383,I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter just on an off chance you know and anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel.  So I called there they said he left yesterday.  But apparently he comes here every year always follows the same route.  He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano.  I called.  And they told me he's checked in. <BR> Where's Positano? <BR> It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning... <BR> Oh no I don't think that would be a good idea. <BR> Look I know there's no going back for us.  That's not it.  I just want to make this up to you.  Clear my relationship karma.  And I know the area I've got some cousins down there.  Please.  Let me do this for you.  Let this be my gift to you.
5384,What...happened? <BR> Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good actually. 
5385,Jimmy!  That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice eh? But to give them a chance at justice. <BR> And are they going to get it? <BR> They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics sure because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying 'Maybe... maybe...' <BR> Maybe what? <BR> Maybe I can do something right. <BR> And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...? <BR> That's what I'm going to try to do.
5386,...what do you got? <BR> Military Special Programs... <u>Programs</u>... No I am not Shouting at you I'm... I'm sorry.  Anyone named <u>Shoe</u> Schumann?  <u>Schuster</u>... uh
5387,And do you trust me? <BR> I could be convinced if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ... <BR> It wasn't me; you have my word.
5388,Tribuus what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed? <BR> He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
5389,What's the secret to making a woman happy? <BR> Oh that's easy you just gotta find the clitoris. <BR> Huh?
5390,What the hell are you doing -- ? <BR> If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...

5392,What do you mean? <BR> I mean it's a good story. <BR> Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends what kind of friend are you? <BR> Exactly. Life just wouldn't be worth living would it?
5393,Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit? <BR> Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me. <BR> I can imagine... you know all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself? <BR>  <BR> Oh come now as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-? <BR> There's the script to go back to the Guild- <BR> I've got it. <BR> - and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man. <BR> Right here. <BR> It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of... <BR> That's my job.  See you at tea time... <BR> Eve...  ... by any chance did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time? <BR> Oh golly. And I forgot to tell you- <BR> Yes dear. You forgot all about it. <BR> Well I was sure you'd want to of course being his birthday and you've been so busy these past few days and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home... <BR> Yes I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you Eve. <BR> Mr. Sampson's birthday. I certainly wouldn't forget that. You'd never forgive me.  As a matter of fact I sent him a telegram myself...
5394,I can subpoena you you know. I can get you up there on the stand. <BR> And ask me what? <BR> Who put my client in the hospital for life. <BR> I didn't do it Mister. <BR> Who are you protecting then? <BR> Who says that I'm protecting anyone? <BR> I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them? <BR> I don't owe them a goddamn thing. <BR> Then why don't you testify? <BR> You know you're pushy fella... <BR> You think I'm pushy now wait 'til I get you on the stand... <BR> Well maybe you better do that then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
5395,You should've called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped. You go starting private investigations using people you don't even know... <BR> What difference does that... <BR> Your Detective told you a nakedfaced lie.
5396,Go to the police station! <BR> Deputy Webber's at the party. It's only three blocks away.
5397,Look Faz Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  What was that he said...? <BR> I remember Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till. <BR> Pinhead! Don't just blurt it right out.
5398,I'm going out for awhile. <BR> Do you want the car? <BR> No I'm just gonna walk around. <BR> Alright.
5399,Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it! <BR> They'll be back. <BR> Oh come on! Can't you be happy for one split second? They're gone!
5400,I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you? <BR> Yes and just one time can be enough.  Thank you. <BR> Thank you Norman. <BR> Norman. <BR> You're not going to... to your room already? <BR> I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix. <BR> Phoenix? <BR> I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me too. <BR> Why don't you stay a little while just for talking. <BR> I'd like to but... <BR> Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.

Pay taxes? <BR> Well I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here? <BR> You're goin' out to Las Vegas you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean after all you're the one having a good time not me.
5402,--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci-- <BR> --this White House guy a good one a pro came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said well we think it's important and he said if it's so goddamn important who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein? <BR> Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk-- <BR> --well I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around wouldn't you say so?-- <BR> --absolutely--and that's all they do sit sit sit--every once in a while they call up a Senator some reporting-- <BR> --well what if your boys get it wrong--
5403,Yeah we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name? <BR> Buffy.
5404,Does it hurt? <BR> Of course it hurts. What does it look like? <BR> I thought maybe he was pretending.

You know... <BR> Hnnn. <BR> Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all but this St. Peter's it's top of the line eh? <BR> Yeah. <BR> You know Paul I've been thinking maybe this is as good a time as any to have a little talk you know about -- well --
5406,"You don't see what's going on here, do you?  There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job. <BR> And they want to blame us? <BR> Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred -- <BR> But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't. <BR> -- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI -- <BR> -- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this. <BR> She's in there right now saying the same thing about you. <BR> I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device. <BR> Agent Scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building. That you wanted to go back."
5407,So. How are you adjusting? <BR> I'm adjusting okay. <BR> And your new apartment? <BR> Apartment's okay. <BR> Are you taking your medication? <BR> It gives me headaches. <BR> But you are taking it? <BR> Yeah.
5408,What? <BR> The Boxes. In the House. I told you. <BR> What do you mean? <BR> The boxes! I TOLD you. <BR> You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got... <BR> Yeah. The things you were talking about.
5409,You think they'll ever find him? <BR> I don't know Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it. <BR> Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean? <BR> Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
5410,As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them? <BR> If you persist you leave us no choice.
5411,Let's beat it man.  I don't like it up here. <BR> What are you scared of heights? <BR> I dunno man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - - <BR> Look Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof all right?  No big loss. <BR> That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him. <BR> Gimme a break will you?  Shut up. <BR> Five stories straight down. There was no blood in the body. <BR> No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
5412,Don't you ever have any problems? <BR> I have one now. <BR> So do I. <BR> Tell me about it. <BR> Why would a man leave his apartment three times on a rainy night with a suitcase? And come back three times? <BR> He likes the way his wife welcomes him home. <BR> Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today? <BR> Homework. It's more interesting. <BR> What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper? <BR> Nothing thank heaven. <BR> Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day? <BR> I wouldn't dare answer that. <BR> Lisa -- there's something terribly wrong.
5413,'Asian Dawn Movement?' <BR> I read about them in Time magazine.  When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further instructions.  You have two hours to comply.
5414,Just tell it to me straight Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault? <BR> I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out. <BR> I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop. <BR> You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope. <BR> Did you see it coming when she sat us down here? <BR> Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs. <BR> That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him. <BR> Oh Mac no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea.
5415,I don't. <BR> You will if you wanna eat.  Right George?
5416,I needed a break. <BR> Where are we? <BR> We're about an hour away. <BR> I can't believe I slept. <BR> You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about? <BR> I dream I'm asleep.  I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up.  I don't think I smoke.
5417,Sorry. <BR> Good way to get your head blown off. <BR> I'll try not to remember to warn Evelyn.
5418,...stunned commissioners into the hallway where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave. <BR> We all have a past. You have a past I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me. <BR> Long suspected of running the Tangiers without... <BR> ...twenty years in order to find nothin' on me -
5419,You got a date already? <BR> We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist  she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
5420,...she took care of the valet parkers the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything. <BR> Thanks a lot.
5421,I... What do you want? <BR> Well I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam? <BR> Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is - <BR> Well what is this? <BR> Well why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband. <BR> To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean what would be the point. Would you pass the butter? <BR> I was honest with you. I told you who I was. <BR> Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand.  Of course in that case why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat you don't need food.
5422,Can you feel it Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance? <BR> Oh yes Icky.  I can feel it. <BR> This is what my entire life has been directed at this moment this threshold. <BR> Okay arms up lean forward.
5423,How are you today? <BR> Okay I guess. <BR> Here we are.
5424,If you know where it is get there! <BR> Me? You've gotta be kidding.
5425,What are you doing? <BR> This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was. <BR> Well I'd like to read them. <BR> No. We're going to lock this up and -- <BR> STOP IT!  I want to read them! If you don't want to then just leave. But don't you push me around like I'm some mule you paid for -- I already GOT A HUSBAND!
5426,Everybody's talkin' about ya Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived. <BR> Guess I'm just lucky. <BR> That's just what they're calling ya pal. Lucky Luciano.
5427,What is it? <BR> Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong! <BR> We have to get off this beam! <BR> I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
5428,Let's move. <BR> I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
5429,At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God and the rules don't apply. <BR> Without us Masseria don't stand a chance and he knows it.
5430,Look at you cutey! What are we doing? <BR> This kid Joe Early is going to beat the shit out of me.
5431,Spice!... pure un-refined spice! <BR> Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him.  May his passage cleanse the world.
5432,So -- what do we do now? <BR> Find the jacket. <BR> Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that? <BR> First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car. <BR> It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas.
5433,Get your field gear take stuff for overnight. You're goin' with Crawford. <BR> Where? <BR> Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it? <BR> I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid the CU- 5 with film packs and batteries.
5434,Why what would you do? <BR> I could try to...make it stop. <BR> No. I don't want it to. <BR> So it's helping?
5435,I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up? <BR> You hear that?
5436,"Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be... <BR> It's not really a good time, guys..."
5437,He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it! <BR> It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to. <BR> He *smells* like he could put you to sleep! <BR> He's a doctor Buster--doctors smell like ether. <BR> *You're* a doctor Homer--you don't smell like ether. <BR> I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school! <BR> But you've studied with the old man for *years*! <BR> I'm *not* a doctor! <BR> I'm sorry Homer.
5438,Twelve Young answer the radio. I have a call for you. <BR> She said to me I love the way you talk on the radio. <BR> I can't wait all night Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service. <BR> Don't worry hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember you owe me. <BR> You're going to three-four Avenue C 17 year-old female cardiac arrest no further information. <BR> Ten-four hon.
5439,I'm sorry. <BR> What do you want? <BR> Save yourself....
5440,What do you want? <BR> I'm sorry Sid please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please Sid don't be mad at me. <BR> Do you work for her now? <BR> Well yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah shit Sid I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard a smile slowly appearing. <BR> Me too. Randy. Me too.
5441,Don't make me come there. Answer me. <BR> I love you.
5442,--well shit we oughtta be tense-- we're about to accuse Mr. Haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in America of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House--  --it would be nice if we were right-- <BR> --you double-checked both sources?--
5443,There must be a quarter-million out there Edgar.  They've been at it now for a year.  Young kids just like Tricia.  I don't know.  Do you think they have a point Edgar?  Maybe this whole damned system of government is ... <BR>  <BR> The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond. <BR> Don't listen to 'em don't quit. Remember - Kennedy Bobby and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace! <BR> We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office. <BR> Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office. <BR> We took his system out. <BR> That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is. <BR> Who do you think is behind it? <BR> Well you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself I believe maybe the leaker. <BR> Kissinger? <BR>  <BR> Jesus I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it Edgar? <BR> I always get my man. <BR> Yeah you do.  I'd be bugging myself Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes? <BR> No one.  Your property.  It would prove your case.  Why do you think Kissinger's taping your calls?  For history.  His word against yours -- and right now he's got the records.
5444,What? Really? <BR> Uh huh now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face I wanna do some appraising.
5445,Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines. <BR> Excuse me Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
5446,I'm not shy. I've been looked at before. <BR> It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
5447,Another rough night huh?  That it? <BR> Yeah.  That's it.
5448,At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company.  Small but profitable.  They asked if you would endorse their oil.  We could get some very nice posters.  Make some very big money... <BR>  <BR> Think about it!  Just think about it!
5449,Finished what? <BR> Learning language. <BR> Which one? <BR> All 900.
5450,What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf. <BR> All living things pay dues Conor.  They must be respected for that.
5451,Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality? <BR> What are you talking about? <BR> I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up assuming responsibility of yourself. <BR> I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth. <BR> I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships... <BR> Who else? <BR> Charles Moore for instants. <BR> You don't like Moore? Since when? <BR> It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here. <BR> What does Moore have to do with your growing? <BR> I just don't see him in the big picture. <BR> I've known him since Cub Scouts. <BR> He's weird. <BR> He's quiet. <BR> He's weird.
5452,All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid. <BR> My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist. <BR> I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends. <BR> I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit. <BR> But if he'd been sent to jail there would be no Jody. <BR> So I should feel happy that he got away with it? <BR> I don't know. I kind of am.
5453,Looking for someone? <BR> You never know who you'll see.
5454,Shall I answer it? <BR> No just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.
5455,I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree-- <BR> I am not concerned Mr. Harley with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine. <BR> I was only hoping to make you understand. <BR> My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth. <BR> Perhaps if you could explain a little-- <BR> I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed Mr. Harley?
5456,If I look weak now it's over. <BR> I'm very sorry... I didn't... <BR> Oh God. Don't start actin' like a fuckin' wife on me.
5457,Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like? <BR> Like? Uh...hmmm. Well... <BR> I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud? <BR> Let's see it closed at uh 41 1/8...  Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield...
5458,Whatever you come recommended. We... <BR> Recommended? <BR> Must I speak to you in French? <BR> Didnt you say I came recommended?  Thats what I thought. May I know by whom? <BR> You may not. And besides it is irrelevant. <BR> Okay. Recommended... <BR> Good. Now as I trust you may have guessed we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person Mr Lombard? <BR> Look Mrs Spitz... I dont know to whom Im indebted for the recommendation but... Im not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that Mrs Spitz. <BR> What I can appreciate is insolence Mr Lombard!
5459,Aren't you going to answer it? <BR> Well I'm not expecting anyone either.
5460,I don't need this--I know all about my condition. <BR> It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
5461,Another Frank...? <BR> ...everybody. Mike says 'Pat you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says 'No but my sister has...'  Everyone. Buy yourself one too.
5462,Can I go in? <BR> That's not a problem that's not a p- <BR> Can I go in? <BR> Jeff would you go in with her?
5463,Mr. Nevins? <BR> Who's this? <BR> Pamela Landy again. Where do we stand?
5464,You promised you'd meet projections Alan.  A dollar sixty per share you said.  So I don't think this is so surprising a visit. <BR> Projections were far too optimistic. <BR> Admittedly... <BR> Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share. <BR> But the expectation was ten.  And in this case expectation is everything. <BR> Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>? <BR> My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions. <BR> The stock will turn. <BR> It probably will.  In fact I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will in time.  Why should I settle for that? <BR> Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way vote your shares... <BR> You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts. <BR> You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now... <BR> What? <BR> Your father was a friend.  Goddamn it... I watched you grow up.  How do you end up treating me like this?
5465,Oh right. Yeah that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb. <BR> Sick.
5466,Well I don't know what you had in mind but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you my reputation and you're making me look like an idiot. <BR> What do you mean? What did I do to you... <BR> Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...? <BR> David please -- <BR> STOP CALLING ME THAT! MY NAME IS NOT DAVID AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE YOU'RE MORE FUCKED UP THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE!
5467,Phillippe -- he's very bright he's perceptive but he is in such turmoil -- <BR> You grow fond of him.  That's good. <BR> Don't play God with me Aramis I --
5468,Figures. <BR> Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
5469,President Kennedy threatened to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces.  You could do the same ... <BR> I'm not Jack Kennedy.  Your agency is secure. <BR> Not if I give you all the cards ... <BR> I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two maybe three years ... In the meantime your agency will continue at current levels of funding. <BR> Current levels may not be sufficient. <BR> The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
5470,Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer made us both an offer:  you take a fall. <BR> What the hell are you talking about Greek?
5471,How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk. <BR> You think so? <BR> Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade. <BR> He still does. <BR> I hate 'em. <BR> It's not his fault. He had a hard life. <BR> Yeah? <BR> You've heard the stories right? <BR> No.
5472,I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms. <BR> Could we step outside?
5473,Why else would they be willing to put you under... ? <BR> Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank Zurich. <BR> They don't care about you anymore. Alive or dead is the same as long as they bury you deep enough.
5474,The map said to go left. <BR> Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right. <BR> Oh yeah.
5475,I told you this morning you'd come around but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well won't you sit down? <BR> Richard I had to see you. <BR>  <BR> Please. <BR> Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely. <BR> You can ask any price you want but you must give me those letters. <BR> I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal. <BR> I know how you feel about me but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important. <BR> Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for? <BR> It was your cause too. In your own way you were fighting for the same thing. <BR> I'm not fighting for anything anymore except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
5476,And a sort of slightly sick feeling? <BR> That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory. <BR> Oh yes! I hadn't noticed that!
5477,Barstows 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever youre heading I reckon somebodyll pick you up. <BR> Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesnt appeal to you... <BR> Is that where lawyers toil for an industry that turns serial killers into heroes who give thrills to young women who write erotic novels about psychopaths and rapists?  You go to your world Ill stay in mine. So long Mister.
5478,I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ... <BR> He's gotten involved --
5479,I gotta go baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone. <BR> I love you. Come home.
5480,Mom Michael won't talk to me. <BR> Shouldn't he be at home?
5481,No cowboy shit up there understand? <BR> No cowboy shit. Right.
5482,Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring. <BR> Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this. <BR> I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. <BR> Marge calm down you're being hysterical. <BR> He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day -- <BR> Shut up! Shut up!
5483,I'm not going John. <BR> Ian you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  I will not  be known only for my failures.  And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  You're too smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr. Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance at redemption.  For both of us. There's no time to equivocate we must seize it now before --
5484,I would have said it was impossible but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful. <BR> Sire I -- <BR> You blush!  You do not wish to be beautiful to your King?
5485,Wife around? <BR> No.  No.  Well sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years. <BR> Oh.  Sorry.  How so?
5486,But we need a creative dissent. Our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus but the differences are differences of emphasis not of fundamentals. Now the new alignment's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements rather than march along in parallel line that never converge.  Tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly we will gain a new unity. <BR> What?
5487,Rita he's only twelve years old <BR> He'll never appreciate it more.
5488,Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after himself ... <BR> Jesus ... <BR> The business has changed...
5489,I have to pee.  If the waiter comes order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale okay? <BR> You got it.
5490,Say Professor Tripp is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself you know like last longer? <BR> Christ Traxler. How the hell should I know? <BR> Well jeez you're reading his biography aren't you?
5491,George Sanders? <BR> Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself only he couldn't remember how. <BR> Pills. August 25 1972. In a Costa Brava hotel room.
5492,That's it then. <BR> That's all? <BR> Sorry to waste your time. <BR> Oh no problems. Don't worry. <BR> Just one thing. <BR> Yes.
5493,It's an apartment. <BR> Not a dump then but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy. <BR> Patrick let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us. <BR> Yeah.
5494,Where's the dog? <BR> My husband's out looking for him. <BR> He run away often? <BR> That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something right?
5495,Other than the obvious there's nothing wrong with him that I can see not on the outside. <BR> Then what the hell happened to him?
5496,Do we know anything about him? <BR> Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here. <BR> David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'? <BR> Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
5497,Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice. <BR> The pill was pink I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
5498,It's quite satifactory. <BR> Good because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one man: you better fucking use it. <BR> I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes... <BR> You sure about this? <BR> I'd stake my reputation. <BR> But would you stake your life that's the question... <BR> In this business your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same.
5499,Where are they? <BR> Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery the sooner will they be safe.
5500,Most of 'em are late-model... <BR> That's right. Only 10 exotics ... <BR> We'll have to start beating the bushes find out where they live...
5501,I could use some therapy. <BR> Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
5502,What? <BR> How's your hernia? <BR> Don't make me laugh.
5503,I don't want to wait for his call. <BR> Jeanne be patient. <BR> I want to be with him always... <BR> Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood you will be at one with him. <BR> I want to be at one with Him now.
5504,Gregor is that you? <BR> Much to your disappointment no doubt. <BR> It was a mistake it shouldn't have happened. <BR> I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me! <BR> So what do we do? <BR> What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.
5505,Here try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then. <BR> It's beautiful. <BR> A little dusty.
5506,I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back. <BR> That's what they call a family problem.
5507,"Oh huh... <BR> ...they have the capacity to Meld into the <u>Woods</u> and... <BR> And one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of... <BR> I'm just talking about the Hats. <BR> The hats. <BR> A beret. <BR> Why a beret? <BR> Cause you can crush it and put it in your pocket. <BR> ...the special detachment..."""" Good!  What is it?"""
5508,I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames. <BR> I am the desert where water disappears-- <BR> --I am the sea which covers the desert forever under its weight. <BR> --I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea escaping...
5509,How was it? I don't recall. <BR> It was great baby. Let's get you to the ER.
5510,You want to drive? <BR> My license expired let's get out of here. <BR> Sure...
5511,... Bank President three tellers and one guard... <BR> Usually on the right side as you go in. <BR> Nail him first be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car a rover shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns. <BR> For exits off Main Street. <BR> Should be light traffic that time of day... the Bank Guard carries a .38. These will stop an M.2 at fifty yards.
5512,New guy... <BR> Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ? <BR> The Users...you really think they're still there? <BR> They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
5513,By the way Jack this looks like a pretty straight-forward transaction to me but we should get into it soon -- just take a few minutes maybe up at the house ... <BR> He's all business ain't he Trini?  Dick we could've had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal.  We brought you down here 'cause we wanted to talk to you ...
5514,Don't snap at them! <BR> They're driving me nuts! <BR> They're singing.
5515,John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  .... <BR> Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.
5516,I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational. <BR> Thirty-seven. I just can't... <BR> Goodbye Dante.
5517,You want ME to go up there? <BR> Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine. <BR> And what if I run into one of those things?
5518,Ah well we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due? <BR> End a April. <BR> Any others? <BR> This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time. <BR> That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life a course. <BR> Oh yah I know that! <BR> They can really take over that's for sure. <BR> You have children?
5519,Sure...lots of guys at the track talk like that... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month...  What's this? I gave you two hundred. <BR> Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes... <BR> ...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans. <BR> Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit. <BR> What do I need a fancy suit for. I don't hobnob with the jet set. I just fix their planes.
5520,What about the rest? <BR> When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.
5521,Really? <BR> U-huh. <BR> I don't know but you seem sort of distant. <BR> Let's just do it all right? <BR> Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?
5522,"Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY. <BR> What's the matter with her? <BR> Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years. <BR> God, that's terrible. <BR> Yeah. Doctor Malahide's got her doing these jig-saws and things, though. Says it's helping to bring her out."
5523,Two? <BR> Who said there were four? <BR> We understood there were four people living here. Not always of course but now four. <BR> No three. Who said there were four? <BR> How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure? <BR> Yes absolutely. <BR> Take a note of that Mitchell. Only three rather than four. Write it down. You can use numbers or words I have no preference. Which are you using?
5524,Jerry Lundegaard. <BR> All right Jerry you got this phone to yourself? <BR> Well... yah. <BR> Know who this is? <BR> Well yah I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya? <BR> Circumstances have changed Jerry. <BR> Well what do ya mean? <BR> Things have changed. Circumstances Jerry. Beyond the uh... acts of God force majeure.. <BR> What the - how's Jean?
5525,I appreciate it. I do but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit. <BR> No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids for my brother for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.
5526,Maybe you should call the police. <BR> Hey idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car. <BR> I just thought that-- <BR> -- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good at it.
5527,Hey I love you.  So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in there man.  Hang in there. <BR> Thanks...partner.
5528,Ah-ah-ah! <BR> Mother! <BR> Look! Look! The front page!
5529,'Bye Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful!  Gordon is immediately electrified into action. <BR> Oh boy! What a yarn! What a yarn!  Get me Hank on the phone. Gotta hold up the morning edition.
5530,Wait.  Bargain me to Louis for all your lives.  You have done your best.  Let me go and let all of you find peace. <BR> No.  Even if I could give up my friends I could never give up my son.
5531,Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian about it? <BR> Of course. <BR> You won't forget it? <BR> I won't forget. <BR> I seem to be forever thanking you for something don't I?
5532,What other bunch? <BR> The thieves. <BR> I'm not a thief. <BR> Then who are you? <BR> I'm their ride.
5533,... it adds up Buddy 300 here 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow... <BR> How's Mom?
5534,I can't say anything I'm sorry.  <BR> One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy how did that work? <BR> Badly.  You don't realize how close all this came to staying undiscovered--I gave Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave it to Barker who took it to Miami and deposited it.
5535,You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one? <BR> Call the FBI.  Use a pay phone.  Don't give 'em your name Dad.  Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others.  That he's the Nightingale.
5536,Are they close to catching somebody do you think? <BR> I think we may be yes.
5537,And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge? <BR> Frost's bodycount keeps rising and I'm not getting any younger am I?
5538,Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks. <BR> Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!
5539,What? <BR> You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
5540,The cab's waiting! <BR> Where should I hide the car keys? <BR> I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus. <BR> Did you lock the garage door?
5541,Mr. Green? <BR> Yes ma'am. How are you today? <BR> Didn't you get?... How are you? <BR> I'm fine. Can I go up? <BR> Let me see if I can get the doctor hold on one second.
5542,This is it. <BR> Where's Ricky. <BR> I guess inside. Or he never made it. Either way I don't give a shit. Let's get this over with.
5543,We didnt quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man though... <BR> Did Leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved Rhian? <BR> He just said he had good reasons. <BR> Good reasons? <BR> Thats what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldnt take on another child that hed get into trouble... I mean people who sell children... But he wasnt listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think hes back on drugs eh?  Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase you know?  Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some peoples minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leons. He did beat the drug though. He did. <BR> His mother would be pleased to hear that. <BR> Yeah... But he didnt beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parents leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims. <BR> Im afraid I dont understand. <BR> Theyre German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. Its not guilt more of a curse...  And then theres something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think thats just one of Leons dark delusions... <BR> Do you know Leons parents names? <BR> Albert... Albert and Ethel. Why?
5544,Naomi. <BR> On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back erase it explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not maybe not. And then I thought as I always do at this point in my argument about dying.
5545,It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore. <BR> Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun. <BR> No really...
5546,This is spectacular. <BR> That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room and I know how you hate hotels. <BR> A hotel would've been fine.  We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched.
5547,You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes! <BR> Look who's talking! <BR> Leave him alone! <BR> Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that.  Sheila and Kastle sit up.
5548, <BR> You don't owe me a goddamned thing Vincent and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt. <BR> I know. <BR> You better get some sleep alright? <BR> Tell me something first.  The package: what was it? <BR> I don't know.  Nobody knows except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon. <BR> What happened to it? <BR> Gone.  Destroyed. <BR> I guess that's for the best.
5549,That's him! He did it! <BR> Hey mon I don't know what your trip is but...
5550,Okay who's the jerk? <BR> Uh this is our paleobotanist Dr Ellie..... <BR> Sattler.
5551,Terribly sorry I'm late lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab - where's Miss Caswell shall we start? Oh hello Eve... <BR> Hello Miss Channing. <BR> How are you making out in Mr. Fabian's office?  I don't want you working the child too hard Max - just because you promised. As you see I kept my promise too...
5552,Definitely! <BR> I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
5553,Way to go! We're haulin'! <BR> Yes okay exactement!
5554,More the merrier. <BR> No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt I'll tend to her. Dead then I'm coming back for him.
5555,What are you so crazy about the movies for? <BR> It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing. <BR> At least you were never lonely. <BR> I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
5556,Cease can I ask you something? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Why'd you move all the furniture around?
5557,Is it true that you forced Robin Weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic. <BR> He climbed when he was ready. <BR> Were you aware that his brother was killed in a fall.
5558,You're very perceptive. <BR> Hey I read the papers I watch 60 minutes I say to myself these guys are professionals they're motivated they're happening. They want something.  Now personally I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys maybe it's the Hebes Northern Ireland that's none of my business.  I figure You're here to negotiate am I right? <BR> You're amazing.  You figured this all out already? <BR> Hey business is business.  You use a gun I use a fountain pen what's the difference?  To put it in my terms you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans baby...I'm your white knight. <BR> I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying? <BR> The guy upstairs who's fucking things up?  I can give him to you.
5559,Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked. <BR> Thanks Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going. <BR> Opening night? <BR> I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
5560,Ellie they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds! <BR> We were right! <BR> How did you do it?!  How did you do this?!
5561,Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are. <BR> You're hearing about somebody else. <BR> How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial? <BR> When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen. <BR> Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word. <BR> I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing? <BR> You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator. <BR> You don't know how wrong you are.
5562,Was it expensive the beer? <BR> Antonio paid for it. <BR> Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me. <BR> I did forget. Luís told me.
5563,Sarah order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up. <BR> After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
5564,I was driving by -- I saw all the cars.  Are you all right? <BR> Yeah I'm okay -- it's been a long night. <BR> What happened? <BR> Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...

5566,Jenkins ain't no boss.  Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here? <BR> You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
5567,Juno what's the matter? <BR> She's hormonal. Right June? It's just part of the whole process.
5568,Hi Teddy Bear. <BR>  <BR> I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible.

5571,Who was Athos seeking?  Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace? <BR> ... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way. <BR> You may go Lieutenant.
5572,Two? <BR> Yep. I didn't think it was that big but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a- <BR> Oh I-I left it at your house. <BR> snow shovel or anything or something. <BR> I think I left it there I'm sorry.
5573,Good evening. <BR> Good evening. You see here we are again. <BR> I take that as a great compliment to Sam.  I suppose he means to you Paris of well happier days.
5574,You know what the difference is between us Violet? <BR> No. <BR> ...  Me neither.
5575,If you're heading towards her room you won't find her. <BR> Where is she? <BR> You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago. <BR> Where'd she go? <BR> She wouldn't say. She apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends.  You blew it Sebastian. That girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again.
5576,Don't worry James I'll figure something out. <BR> I'm not worried. You're not worried are you. Professor Tripp? <BR> I'm a little worried James. <BR> Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled. <BR> Well let's see if we can keep that from happening.
5577,More denunciations? <BR> One Senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.
5578,Nine-thirty Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting. <BR> He likes to play the great man.
5579,You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad either. <BR> The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank. <BR> Come on. Can I keep this one in the house? <BR> Now look  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important. <BR> Okay. <BR> All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money this doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life.
5580,All right!  Tell us about the truck! <BR> Uh uh I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
5581,"Oh, you mean Fred. <BR> No, Del. <BR> Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything. <BR> You knew Del?! <BR> Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one. <BR> He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!"
5582,We need guns. <BR> We don't need guns. <BR> I'm pretty sure we do. <BR> I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him <BR> All the more reason. <BR> You wouldn't even know where to get one. <BR> Wanna bet? <BR> You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse how you gonna get a gun? <BR> That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden. <BR> It was six in the fucking morning. <BR> Float me a hundred bucks. <BR> Why? <BR> You wanna see how fast I get a gun? <BR> You're out of money? <BR> No. <BR> What do you have left? <BR> Eighty. <BR> Eighty bucks?!? <BR> Eighty five. <BR> What happened to the fifteen hundred? <BR> You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while. <BR> I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks! <BR> You did? <BR> Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room? <BR> What about it? <BR> They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
5583,His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward. <BR> Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run. <BR> But it takes a particularly low type of man to do it.
5584,What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl Frankie? You hear a little girl Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?! <BR> Wait a sec Nicky Nicky Nicky. Ta- take it easy.
5585,Oh this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan. <BR> They got heat in Michigan. <BR> Not this kind of heat. <BR> Heat is heat. <BR> Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing. <BR> I'll get right on it.
5586,Nicholas... <BR> That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
5587,My prop guy had a guy out here. <BR> Get it in the stacks at the Library of Congress Now.  Who's seeing the guy at C.B.S.?
5588,Too deep to anchor out there. <BR> Looks like it's adrift.
5589,There won't be a next thing. <BR> Take a few days -- <BR> I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant. <BR> I hate to ruin your fairy tale but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
5590,"There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater. <BR> You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy. <BR> Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody? <BR> Who are you? <BR> Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the Oceanographic Institute. "
5591,Diem?  Trujillo?  Lumumba?  Guatemala? Cuba? ... It's a shame you didn't take similar precautions Dick. <BR> I'm interested in the documents that put your people together with ... the others.  All of them ...
5592,You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals. <BR> I get my own help. <BR> You run the job but I run the show. You got two weeks to set it up.
5593,And this has what to do with me? <BR> I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
5594,I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing. <BR> Anyone at home? <BR> I live there. Alone. <BR> Someone is sitting in that window. <BR> My mother.
5595,Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow. <BR> We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
5596,Frankie I -- <BR> -- Shut up! Don't you try to make me feel bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. This is on your head not mine.  Break his arm.
5597,Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty? <BR> I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him? <BR> Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people. <BR> I'm working for his daughter. <BR> That right?... She used to be some looker. <BR> She ain't exactly long in the tooth now. <BR> She must be about thirty-three thirty- four. <BR> You must be thinking of a different daughter. <BR> No he's only got one I remember her age I read it in the newspapers when she ran away. <BR> She ran away? <BR> Oh yeah it was a big thing at the time. Julian Cross' daughter. God almighty. She was a wild little thing.
5598,They call me Swede. <BR> Who's they? <BR> Everybody.
5599,I was just about to go to the door when that man did my job for me. Was it alright? <BR> Yes and no. Did you recognize him? <BR> No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall. <BR> I didn't get a good look at him either but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window but I found this key.  Pretty nifty huh? <BR> Yeah if it opens the door. <BR> Yeah.
5600,Finish your prayers? <BR> Finish yours? <BR> Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you. <BR> So sure?
5601,Okay give me the keys. <BR> You bastard. <BR> It's either that or you drive to the police yourself. <BR> The police? <BR> C'mon Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there! <BR> She's not tied up! <BR> You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will. <BR> I am not! <BR> Then let's go talk to her.
5602,Truth is I'm a little nervous. <BR> YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous? <BR> All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure. <BR> Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure! <BR> I do? <BR> You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
5603,Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing. <BR> At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
5604,Stop it! Just cut it out! <BR> You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up you might be in danger of making a *decision*! <BR> For God's sake Homer Wally's been shot down!
5605,I heard they were filthy birds. <BR> Not when they fly.
5606,... you want to be Margo's new understudy. <BR> I don't let myself think about it even-  - but I do know the part so well and every bit of the staging there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No I couldn't possibly... <BR> Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk crawl or roll - she plays. <BR> The show must go on. <BR> No dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy... <BR> Do you think Miss Channing would approve? <BR> I think she would cheer. <BR> But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson- <BR> They'll do as they're told.
5607,What're you doing? You're doing something. <BR> He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these. <BR> Don't give him anything man. Your art's worth a lot. Trade. That's what real artists do with each other. Besides he'll just use you. He's famous for that.
5608,Who are you waiting for? <BR> Stick around and find out.
5609,Where's Roach? <BR> Around somewhere.  Listen I'm in kind of a hurry Johnny U.  What can I do for you? <BR> You gotta tell me where she is. <BR> And let my policy expire?  Sorry. <BR> Look Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over. <BR> I say when it's over! <BR> The guy you killed was an off duty cop!  If you get out of here they'll nail you wherever you land.  They have a new thing called radar. Maybe you've heard of it.
5610,Here's her driver's license. <BR> You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer. <BR> I hate the weird ones.
5611,Baby I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish y'know that we were  <BR> I don't believe it Jean  they're picking straws.
5612,What happened? <BR> Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
5613,Listen Ginger... you know this is probably not... I don't have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now because you're a little upset with Ace. <BR> I do. <BR> I understand that. But you know I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow you know. See what happens. <BR> He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.
5614,You've already robbed the safe? <BR> Oui. <BR> Take what you've got and get out of there.
5615,And you're gonna die after me right? <BR> I guess so. <BR> Would you take these?  And if I die...  Could you throw all my drugs out? Paraphernalia porno you know... Anything that would break my mom's heart.
5616,Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung. <BR> Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me. <BR> You're walking around blind without a cane sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place. <BR> Why do you need to wreck this company? <BR> Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind. <BR> If these people lose their jobs nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word. <BR> It's all about bucks kid the rest is conversation...  Bud you're still going to be president. And when the time comes you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make your father won't have to work another day in his life. <BR> Tell me Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough? <BR> Buddy it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest. <BR> How much is enough Gordon? <BR> The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work two thirds of it comes from inheritance interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules Buddy the news war peace famine upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct kid stick with me. I got things to teach you... <BR> Obviously...
5617,"Who've you told this to, Lenny? <BR> I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off. <BR> Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny. <BR> I've got all these signs here... <BR> C'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say."
5618,Cardiff Giant? <BR> What? <BR> Cardiff Giant. Just check. <BR> Maybe you wanna try the China Club. <BR> Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you? <BR> Hey. I'm half Lebanese.
5619,Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried. <BR> He tried to warn us ...
5620,What you gonna do? Kill me? <BR> Dont tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards. <BR> Huh. Im a businessman. What are you eh?
5621,I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars. <BR> No -- I want to take you to the movies.  Do you think they'd accept these?
5622,Good day to you sir. <BR> Move aside. This is the King's road and the knights you joined arms against were his very own. <BR> I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training. <BR> I am King and this is Excalibur sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you and why do you block the way? <BR> I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service. <BR> --That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility. <BR> Not a boast sir but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel. <BR> Move aside! <BR> I will not. You must retreat or prove your kingship in the test of arms under the eyes of God.
5623,What are you looking at? <BR> What do you see here? <BR> Graffiti -- <BR> Look closer.
5624,He just got Hip to us.  He just ended the War. <BR> What are we gonna <u>do</u> about it...?
5625,Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me Randall. I'm the jane that was left and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps! <BR> Oh. Okay. Right.
5626,...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it. <BR> You mean quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet? <BR> That's all taken out of context. Okay. <BR> Yeah that's out of context. Okay. <BR> I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened. <BR> Well back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad. <BR> Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad. <BR> Yeah? <BR> Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad. <BR> What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me? <BR> What happened to me? What happened to you? <BR> Yeah. <BR> You lost your control. <BR> I lost control? <BR> Yes you lost your control. <BR> Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore. <BR> All right. <BR> A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'... <BR> All right. <BR> ...uh uh cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?! <BR> Yeah. <BR> You know I didn't want to bring this up but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife. <BR> My wife? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Now what does she have to do with all this? <BR> Well she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident. <BR> All of a sudden you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation? <BR> No I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point. <BR> Listen I would - <BR> The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem. <BR> I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you. <BR> Hey she came to talk... <BR> Please... <BR> ...to me. <BR> ...don't do it to me... <BR> She came to talk to me... <BR> Okay? <BR> And I - what was I supposed to do throw her out? <BR> Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business okay? There are certain things you don't do and you know that. <BR> It's none of my business? <BR> That's right yeah. <BR> A week ago it was my business now it's none of my business. In other words when you need me to take care of somethin' for you then you need me. <BR> Yeah that's right the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. I'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this guy.
5627,"There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater. <BR> You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water. <BR> There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island. <BR> A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it! <BR> A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake! <BR> I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there. <BR> We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry; he was dead and his boat was all chewed up."
5628,Wait!  I'll talk to him. <BR> Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
5629,You all put together? <BR> My back's open.  Did the extra help get here? <BR> There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency? <BR> You're not being funny I could get actors for less. What about the food? <BR> The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila. <BR> That French ventriloquist taught you a lot didn't he? <BR> There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake? <BR> The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic too and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late. <BR> Late for what? <BR> Don't be dense. The party. <BR> I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes. <BR> Well I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
5630,Why don't you get some rest? <BR> I've got to work. <BR> You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on... <BR> You're going to stay here...? <BR> Yes.
5631,One for all.  All for one. <BR> If I could have a blade then I would be please to run with you.
5632,Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is? <BR> It's a surprise.
5633,Who...who kills me? <BR> You have nothing to fear William.
5634,Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you? <BR> Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far. <BR> Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat. <BR> I'll manage. <BR> No you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink? <BR> No I'm ok.
5635,How am I a hypocrite? <BR> Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were I'd propose but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.
5636,Mama can I put the candles ... <BR> Hush... not a word about the cake hear?
5637,You're not my daddy. <BR> You gonna bust my horns or you want spaghetti <BR> I want spaghettis.
5638,Eh I don't know. <BR> Oh don't be so coy dear. You're going to Rio. <BR> What? <BR> That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
5639,What is it? You want to help me you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself. <BR> I need to sit down a minute. <BR> Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.
5640,Good luck. <BR> You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
5641,It's okay to break girl. You shatter if you have to. <BR> I'd really just like to be alone.
5642,Affirmative.  Can you get your chopper airborne? <BR> 10-4 in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel. <BR> Get him the hell over to Amity Point the old lighthouse.  Right now. <BR> What for? <BR> There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port. <BR> That's it? <BR> That's it.  Just do it all right? <BR> 10-4   soon as I can raise him. <BR> If they're not at the light look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port! <BR> Affirmative affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.
5643,Because Harold tests thy father's will is no reason to admire him.  Let Harold's worldliness be a warning to thee not an example. <BR> Yes Mother ... <BR> Harold may have lost touch with his Bible but thou must never lapse.
5644,The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment that's conclusive! <BR> Not without a shot of the nest.
5645,Oh my God... What is that? <BR> That's one piece of four problems.
5646,Yeah well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy. <BR> Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one if you know what I mean.
5647,I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that. <BR> Yes.
5648,Laser-envy. <BR> All right that's enough.  Look we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
5649,The water. <BR> What about the water? <BR> When it comes. <BR> When it comes? What'd you tell him? <BR> Comes in different parts of the river. Every night a different part.
5650,This is *your* life story Wilbur! You just changed the dates! <BR>  <BR> You *invented* him! You've completely made his up! <BR> 
5651,I can't believe you hung up on me you dick. <BR> Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
5652,Almost. <BR> Well hurry up so you can come home! We miss you! <BR> I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks! <BR> Oh my God! I completely forgot to tell you! <BR> What? <BR> I got bangs! <BR> Really --
5653,About? <BR> Well the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice because I tell you there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well...  For example on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and um not onto the linen and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother --
5654,What the fuck was you told? Don't talk right? <BR> Unless spoken to ain't that right Horrace. Didn't you say that?
5655,She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it. <BR> You don't say? <BR> Cross was looking for her all over the country. Offered rewards everything. Felt real sorry for him with all his money.
5656,It's not pretty but it does suit our purposes. <BR> Our purposes.
5657,Surprise surprise. <BR> I'm not a field agent all right?  So cut me a break. <BR> An F.B.I. Man asking me for a break. How droll.
5658,Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite. <BR> Guys guys I'm sorry but no way.
5659,Get that will you? <BR> Why do I always have to answer the phone? <BR> Because you're the closest. <BR> I'm not any closer than you are.
5660,Eve... don't cry. <BR> I'm not crying. <BR> Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood? <BR> Some vague promises of a test that's all - if a particular part should come along one of those things- <BR> But the raves about your performance- <BR> - an understudy's performance. <BR> Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison. <BR> He's not my friend. You were my friends... <BR> He can help you. <BR> I wish I'd never met him I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
5661,Youre the lantern man huh?  If you wanna see whats left of him... <BR> The acid bath? <BR> Huh! Youve been around eh?
5662,He doesn't look fifty. <BR> Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
5663,<u>Now</u> Neil.  Stop teasing your sister. <BR> Damn.
5664,Thanks for your help... good luck. <BR> Goodbye Mr. Sampson.
5665,Hello there. Who are you? <BR> Miss Harrington's resting Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is... <BR> We won't disturb her rest. It seems she left her award in the taxicab. Will you give it to her?
5666,I showed you all my conjuring tricks... <BR> The deepest secrets the forbidden formulas... <BR> Maybe... maybe...
5667,Well then perhaps you also --- <BR> -- This is Mr. Laszlo.
5668,Two. <BR> I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand. <BR> I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges. <BR> That's my job.
5669,You're scared. <BR> I'm not scared. <BR> Neither am I. <BR> Maybe you should be.
5670,It's important for you to know who your father was isn't it? <BR> [Beat] Yeah it is.
5671,Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this? <BR> They're not home yet. <BR> Brad what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work? <BR> I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson? <BR> I'll explain everything later.
5672,Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very -- <BR> Patrick we're in the middle of -- <BR> She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
5673,...This is a nice place. <BR> Yah ya know it's the Radisson so it's pretty good. <BR> You're livin' in Edina then? <BR> Oh yah couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson! <BR> Oh yah a long time ago. <BR> Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed ya know to discuss that? <BR> Oh yah but there's not a heckuva lot to discuss. What about you Mike? Are you married - you have kids? <BR> Well yah I was married. I was married to - You mind if I sit over here?
5674,A simple reason McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank. <BR> I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8. <BR> What do you add up to here? <BR> One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million. <BR> A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts. <BR> So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you. <BR> The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now. <BR> No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises. <BR> Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled. <BR> I bet.
5675,He's knocked out!  He's knocked out!  Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!  Daddy daddy! <BR> Let's get you out.
5676,Joker here. Can we talk? <BR> I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.' <BR> Huh. Demands. Well gents this is kinda embarrassing but... I'm having such a swell time I just haven't thought any up.
5677,Hiya Lou. <BR> Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
5678,Look at you you-you're such a clown. <BR> I look pretty. <BR> Well yeah you always look pretty but that guy with you...
5679,Where are you going now? <BR> Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--
5680,"I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins. <BR> Martin, we hired the best man we could find."
5681,I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR half-shrouded in the light. <BR> I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey... <BR> I don't give a shit about your patient! <BR> I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But incidentally you should because you're birds of a feather.
5682,Fine -- I've waited over three centuries.  I can wait a little longer. <BR> Why did you wait? <BR> It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind Macleod. <BR> It will not end tonight. <BR> You cannot hide from me.  You will not stand between me and my destiny. After I have your head the power will let me hold any form as long as I want.  Do you know what that means? I can become the President -- I can become anyone I want.  The world will be mine.
5683,Hey Mark. Is that you? <BR> Damone! You come here? <BR> I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back? <BR> Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey Damone have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy this is Mike Damone.
5684,Merlin help me. I need your help. I don't know how-- <BR> 'Help me Help me.' Help me get up.
5685,Hi Mark. <BR> Hi Stacy. How are you? <BR> I'm fine. Mark I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year.
5686,How about a lift mister? <BR> Can't you see that sticker?
5687,You watch this garbage? <BR> This is a legitimate cinematic genre. Just like Westerns Comedies Film Noire Science Fiction...
5688,That was fun. I don't think California is bad at all. It's a drag coming home. <BR> Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt. <BR> I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore. <BR> I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this? <BR> If only I had the nerve to break up but it would really hurt him. <BR> If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.
5689,Hello Natalie you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint you're thinking seriously about marrying me... <BR> What are you doing here? <BR> ...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko. <BR> First of all Mr. Fox you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
5690,Mary Rooney the obstetrical nurse... <BR> What did these people do when her heart stopped? <BR> We went to Code Blue... <BR> 'Code Blue' what does that mean...? <BR> It's a common medical expression it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea to get her oxygen her and the baby... Ms. Nevins... <BR> Why wasn't she getting oxygen...? <BR> Well many reasons actually... <BR> Tell me one? <BR> She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask... <BR> She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
5691,Hey Daniel! Hello?  Do you guys speak English? <BR> Uh yeah. <BR> Good.   I have a job for you in America.
5692,Yeah they showed me <BR> Could be unrelated. <BR> Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings? <BR> No. Could be someone's missin' maybe. <BR> That's what I'm thinkin'.
5693,Where are you going?! <BR> Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready. <BR> But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time but -- <BR> He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis and for that he has two more days. <BR> What you're asking is impossible! <BR> I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed without any loss of life even without treason for he too is the son of the King. <BR> But -- <BR> You said you'd do anything Athos anything to replace this King.  So do it.
5694,The Wizard of Gore? <BR> Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror. <BR> Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.
5695,We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come get your numbers in order by then. <BR> First of all... <BR> No first of all. I'm not in a game mood. <BR> You're interrupting a personal conversation. <BR> Sorry Fish.
5696,I know Cartman I know.  I see Kenny every day. <BR> YOU DO?! <BR> Sure dude.  On the face of every child on the smile of every baby...
5697,Krypton! <BR> Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
5698,Thank you so much Judge Wright for another wonderful interview. <BR> Judge Wright?  Now Betty? First name terms surely! <BR> Oh Oliver you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off? <BR> Delighted Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man. <BR> Why Oliver since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man.
5699,Don't you worry about that. <BR> Is this necessary? <BR> Yes. Now come on all or nothing.
5700,Yeah? <BR> Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives. <BR> Sue people like that they're liable to be having dinner with the Judge who's trying the suit.
5701,...why? <BR> ...you the Press Office? <BR> ...Yes. <BR> Earn your money.  ...He's ill the Plane is sick... <BR> ...Good...
5702,I'll be... somewhere else. <BR> Hey Jeff. If you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango try the guy at the end of the hall.
5703,It's feels unreal like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot. <BR> I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things. <BR> You're really good friends with the Chancellor aren't you?
5704,I want you to hear me out. <BR> What. <BR> You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent. <BR> I don't think so. <BR> We are. We go to the police. We tell them the truth. Now. Before they find out. Now. We save ourselves.
5705,But they both worked at the White House? <BR> I will not talk about the other two. <BR> Kalmbach--Nixon's personal lawyer.
5706,Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car? <BR> It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold. <BR> No no it's the president of the company himself -- come all the way out here to make Jenkins general manager. So why you acting so mean?
5707, <BR> Who told you this? <BR> You did in the future. You figured it out because a part of you already knows this. That's how it works. [Beat] I'm just telling you something you already know even if you haven't realized it.
5708,Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid.. <BR> Shush. <BR> I'm gonna pee. You want anything?
5709,Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa. <BR> Vanessa right?
5710,But nobody had to take care of Nicky. <BR> You find any cash in there we'll whack it up with you. <BR> I mean he took care of himself only too well. And that's why every badge back home wanted to nail him.
5711,Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey we're supposed to get to know each other. <BR> How'm I doing so far? <BR> So far you're great. You got a cigarette?
5712,What's wrong? <BR> Sit down a moment Billy.  I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
5713,Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you. <BR> Why should they think that? <BR> You told them. You said I arrived on a camel shot you four times. Left you for dead. <BR> Frankly that's how I remember it. <BR> But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you Steed but it's not my style. <BR> Perhaps your memory plays tricks Mrs. Peel. <BR> That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained he said it was just as someone had promised. <BR> Did he say who? <BR> No. But he must know. Incidentally my double left you with this.
5714,You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts. <BR> You've seen one naked breast you've seem them all. <BR>  <BR> You're quick. I like that. <BR> You think you're working with chimps here? <BR> The thing is I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word. <BR> Keeping your word is something I can actually respect Ted.
5715,Listen you clowns there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest! <BR> We'll take our chances.  Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.
5716,You're drunk. <BR> You're a whiz kid. So perceptive so --
5717,The money. You don't know where it came from? <BR> Unh unh. <BR> When you think about them... the money... the key ... does it make you remember anything?
5718,We can work this out can't we? <BR> This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
5719,Real times. <BR> They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life as you prepare for new roles; father husband teacher you will as I have come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon the mellowing will begin...
5720,She's done it. <BR> She certainly has. <BR> It's coming. <BR> It certainly is.
5721,I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl. <BR> Clever observation. Go back to Wichita.  Oh that's right you can't.
5722,I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in. <BR> That's what they get for not locking the door. <BR> So I'm standing there and you could hear a pin drop.  No breathing or snoring... Suddenly it hits me that somethin' was goin' on that just stopped really fast like people are holding their breath.
5723,Then to the Bastille. <BR> To the Bastille.  And death.
5724,Aren't you? <BR> I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.
5725,I thought you'd killed Freddy off. <BR> We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So Evil never dies right?  Anyway a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator? <BR> I thought he'd stopped doing horror. <BR> Believe it or not he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  They're his inspiration.  But now he's got a new script in the works.
5726, <BR> You're crazy! <BR>  <BR> Alvy you're a total paranoid. <BR>  <BR> Ah Max you uh... <BR> Stop calling me Max. <BR> Why Max? It's a good name for you. Max you see conspiracies in everything. <BR>  <BR> Right Max. California Max. <BR> Ah. <BR> Let's get the hell outta this crazy city. <BR> Forget it Max. <BR> We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there Max. <BR> No I cannot. You keep bringing it up but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light. <BR> Right Max forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie? <BR> I'm gonna meet her in front of the Beekman. I think I have a few minutes left. Right?
5727,Did all these people die in wars? <BR> Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery? <BR> No -- I'm afraid not. <BR>  <BR> I'll tell you Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away. <BR> Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this? <BR> They have cemeteries. But not like this one... You see they don't have any wars.
5728,How was the beach? <BR> Fine. <BR> Surf conditions okay? <BR> A little mushy. <BR> A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it Utah if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls? <BR> Babes. <BR> What? <BR> The correct term is babes sir.  Uh this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  Otherwise penetration is not possible sir. Of the social infrastructure I mean.
5729,Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can. <BR> If only Alex and I had done that with the others Alex might still be...
5730,They're okay if they got little white canes and tin cups. <BR> That's awful. <BR> What the hell.  Did your mom put all this together?
5731,This here's the desert an' we're right in it! <BR> I wisht it was day. <BR> Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place. <BR> Man bones? <BR> Some I guess but mos'ly cow bones.
5732,The so-called art of acting is not one for which I have a particularly high regard... <BR> Hear hear... <BR> But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote. <BR> He does not exaggerate. I was good. <BR> You were great.
5733,A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job. <BR> Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it okay? We'll see what we can work out. <BR> Ten o'clock tomorrow morning. I'll be there.
5734,I don't know. <BR> Look if I draw the short straw then I'll do it but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
5735,Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For you know the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right. <BR> I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though so I wasn't jealous.
5736,Hi. I uh think that's us. <BR> Hi. I'm Jimmy. <BR> Bobby.
5737,So... pretty nice house you've got here. <BR> Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
5738,What is this stuff? Kevlar? <BR> Better. It's not on the market yet. <BR> It doesn't protect your head though. <BR> That's why I wear a target on my chest.
5739,Who is it? <BR> It's me. <BR> Who? <BR> Me. <BR> Francis...?
5740,Mother of God ...have mercy ... <BR> Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
5741,That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass -- <BR> Fuck you Roy Ostrey! <BR> -- small-time pissant Barney Fife --
5742,Now listen. Now that you're on your way it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you. <BR> I don't love him. I love Ronald. <BR> So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible. <BR> But that would make me a slut.  Wouldn't it? <BR> Cecile everybody does it. It's just that nobody talks about it.
5743,Guys I don't mean to be rude but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to... <BR> Oh right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well actually two. Actually no there was that other guy who...well <u>very few people</u> have done it. <BR> Hyp I'll do anything.
5744,We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard... <BR> Over the Edge of the World.
5745,That's a long story my friend. You see I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants. <BR> Hey whadda you tryin' to dokid me? <BR> Oh I wouldn't kid you . On the level it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants. <BR> What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up. <BR> It's okay with me. I'm not arguing. <BR> Fresh guy huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose. <BR> Look here partner. You may not like my nose. But I do. It's a good nose. The only one I've got. I always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it. If you decide to do it make sure you don't miss.
5746,I just want you to know Joe how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside. <BR> What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you? <BR> I just wanted you to know they meant a lot. <BR> It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans? <BR> Well what I wanna do is go back to work. But I got this Scagnetti prick deep up my ass. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job. My plans have always been to be part of the team again.
5747,Well what else do we do? <BR> How about making friends?
5748,Mickey?  What are you doing here? <BR> Violet it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident. <BR> Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt? <BR> I think everything is okay.
5749,No Rex is not going to die.  Julie you know where the sewing stuff is don't you? <BR> Sure.  We'll do an operation Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
5750,Good things about Tom Ripley? Could take some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is tender... Tom is beautiful... <BR> You're such a liar... <BR> ...Tom is a mystery...
5751,My husband... <BR> Well where's the sonuvabitch!? <BR> He's dead. <BR> What?
5752,I went and looked at some babies just now. <BR> Oh? <BR> I guess you have to go on faith. <BR> Some times...
5753,I have a CB in my truck we could get some help out here. <BR> Who the hell would you call? <BR> Anyone.
5754,Taking ol' Leo somewhere? <BR> Leo's been out here too long man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.
5755,John! <BR> Holly we have to stop meeting like this.  So that's what it was.  A fucking robbery.  So why nuke the building Hans?
5756,Vannacutt!! <BR> Or somebody wanting me to believe that.
5757,It's crazy out there.  Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face? <BR> Maybe because you're looking her in the face.
5758,How's the name search going? <BR> 37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.
5759,Hey you two! What's going on? <BR> I was sitting there.
5760,What did you say? <BR> The driver was killed. I think there's a connection -- <BR> No about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley? <BR> Yeah. Why you know him? <BR> Know him? We were gonna get married! He was gonna leave his wife for me! Fuck!!...
5761,You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch? <BR> I'm sorry I -- <BR> Well tell him I'll be back.
5762,It won't work. That's pure nitro you're dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if you look at is funny. What're you gonna do walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on feather pillows? You don't have a complete layout of the place. Even if you manage to avoid a fight you won't know where to go. <BR> We're hopin' you can show us where ta go Toby. <BR> Oh no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro? <BR> We're gonna blow up the powder magazine. <BR> What? <BR> We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage. <BR> A direct hit'll blow the top off this whole island! How're you gonna fuse the stuff? How're you gonna leave yourself time to get out?
5763,I don't know. <BR> What the hell we're steering for it.
5764,Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities. <BR> Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic. <BR> I bet they like him for his big charity balls. <BR> That and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks. <BR> Well you know me.  The more they've got the less they're worth.  This guy must be the most worthless man in America.
5765,I wanted to kill him. <BR> But you found another choice. <BR> I did. <BR> It wouldn't have changed the way you feel. <BR> It might have.
5766,You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop? <BR> No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
5767,After all the threats and all the bullshit it turned out Ginger didn't tell 'em anything. But by then the Feds didn't need her anyway. <BR> But it was just mine. <BR> They had all the pieces they needed.
5768,What the heck were you thinkin'? Heck if I'm only gettin' bank interest I'd look for complete security. Heck FDIC. I don't see nothin' like that here. <BR> Yah but I - okay I would I'd guarantee ya your money back. <BR> I'm not talkin' about your damn word Jerry. Geez what the heck're you?... Well look I don't want to cut you out of the loop but his here's a good deal.  I assume if you're not innarested you won't mind if we move on it independently.
5769,There are some human experiences Birdie that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's- <BR> You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
5770,Yeah - let her soak.  Come on. <BR> Don't get burned Daphne.
5771,He's too drunk. <BR> He's fine. Okay Mikey let's go.  You guys stay here.

5778,You talked to Jack? <BR> Not since last night. He took a guy hunting. <BR> The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental. <BR> Jack? <BR> The other guy. <BR> Where... how'd you hear that? <BR> CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley who the fuck is he anyhow? <BR> No I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
5779,Well he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers. <BR> Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him. <BR> Oh I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells. <BR> Shells?  Whatever for?
5780,Why didn't you tell us about these guys Ian?! <BR> Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.

5783,It's a generous offer Mr. Galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture... <BR> How did you settle on the amount? <BR> We thought it was just. <BR> You thought it was just. <BR> Yes. <BR> Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy. <BR> That was our insurance company's recommendation. <BR> Yes. It would be.
5784,Suave. goddam are you suave you fucker. You want some beer? <BR> Certainly Frank.  Darling get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
5785,Don't you know anything about limo etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure. <BR> Wait a second I thought we were hamburger guys. <BR> And like every hamburger guy knows when you get your one big chance at the good life you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out.
5786,Listen: when we get back tomorrow you're gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. He's offering you New York. Tell him you want Atlanta. <BR> Why? <BR> Cuz I want New York.

5789,So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife. <BR> Jake listen. <BR> Shut up Duffy you're always in a hurry and his friend says why not do what the Chinese do? So he says what do they do? His friend says the Chinese they screw for a while. Just listen a second Duffy...
5790,Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker you know some connection. <BR> Hey what they did on their time was their business you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag wherever he is.
5791,I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me. <BR> I don't need no more clothes thank you. <BR> Rose I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant too--about a year ago.  I've been through this.

5797,"This is nothing. ...piece of cake.  Y'know, producing is being a Samurai Warrior.  They pay you, day in, day out, for Years, so that, ONE DAY, when <u>called</u> upon, you can respond, your training At Its Peak, and save the day. <BR> BREAN, SHAKING HIS HEAD.  IN THE B.G., MOSS, DRINKING. THE TV COMES TO LIFE."
5798,So if you never got off the plane none of us would be alive in the first place. <BR> That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay it has not been edited.
5799,"Well? Surprised? <BR> What is all this? When are you coming home? <BR> Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry. <BR> Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive. <BR> Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from."
5800,I found Dickie's rings. <BR> What? <BR> You've got Dickie's rings. <BR> I can explain.
5801,Guess I'll just keep working. <BR> What're you crazy? <BR> I like my job.
5802,Listen please accept my apologies for... you know me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well yes it was my idea but... <BR> Do you think I could have some water?
5803,A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene. <BR> Don't sweat it.  It's over. <BR> She had the baby?
5804,That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact I ought to sock you right now. <BR> Anne Schuyler are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
5805,Okay Sammy. <BR> Somethin' huh? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Ginger.
5806,Especially at the casino where he definitely did not work people got the message. <BR> Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  Yeah right I'm sure.
5807,OhMary <BR> Yes sir? <BR> How is she? <BR> Whyuhshe's all right sir. <BR> What's the matter? Anything wrong? <BR> Oh no sir. No different than <BR> Yes. I know. Still in the dumps huh? <BR> Yes sir. If you'll excuse me sirshe sent me for a drink.  Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response he gingerly opens the door.
5808,We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey. <BR> I'm listening.
5809,We can do it... <BR> Sure with three days and a blowtorch. <BR> It's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker'll pop! <BR> No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store -- <BR> -- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there -- <BR> -- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop. <BR> You're starting to sound like Pritchett.
5810,I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!! <BR> Miss Vale was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?
5811,He sees this differently as you well know. <BR> I didn't expect that he would. <BR> You suffered through an agonizing pain last night pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law. <BR> Vincent told you that I'm a cop? <BR> Not a word.  But no ordinary criminal would have the extensive military and medical expertise you do.  And so I place the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that makes sense to me.  You work for some government agency and you carry a gun and in my world that makes you a cop.
5812,Are my eyes really brown? <BR> You will forgive my curiosity Mr. Blaine. The point is an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us. <BR> My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one. <BR> In this case you have no sympathy for the fox huh? <BR> Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound too. <BR> Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
5813,They've abandoned me... like everyone. <BR> What... what do you mean? <BR> It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing... <BR> Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home? <BR> It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home. <BR> But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well you.
5814,Hi. Is Annette at home? <BR> You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you.
5815,This is all that survived? <BR> Actually only one cell survived.. <BR> Have you identified it? <BR> It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200000. <BR> Talk English Doc. <BR> This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered. <BR> Sounds like a freak of nature to me. <BR> Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
5816,You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all. <BR> Stupid. <BR> Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got... <BR> But didn't have heroin.
5817,The weak the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink? <BR> I think I will.
5818,Let's all talk about Mary. <BR> Who are you friend? <BR> Milt Arbogast Private Investigator.  Where is she Miss Crane?
5819,Where were you Jason? In the car. <BR> Conklin up front. <BR> I'll get the book. <BR> No. There's nothing new. <BR> You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down. <BR> Two years we're scribbling in a notebook -- <BR> -- it hasn't been two years -- <BR> -- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
5820,Hi Jennifer. <BR> Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you. <BR> Hi how are you? <BR> Okay Sammy.
5821,Do you think the rex might have the infant with it? <BR> Possible.
5822,You ain't even a man yet. <BR> That ain't what your mama said.
5823,Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail so get out of here before... <BR> Before what?
5824,Hey little bear aren't you going to join the others? <BR> Um my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present sir.
5825,Not bad for government work.  Having a good time. <BR> Haven't had so much fun since Live TV.
5826,Look. You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up talking about what's right and what's wrong. You're from the reservation. It's a different world. <BR> I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. I did four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res. So I know about the other world Ray.
5827,Thank you very much. <BR> All right all right don't mention it. <BR> Give my regards to your managing editor. <BR> I certainly will.
5828,They're getting bigger. <BR> Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
5829,Who's going to do it? <BR> I thought we all were. <BR> I don't thinkI can. <BR> But you're a doctor. You kill people every day. <BR> I don't want to. It's different. <BR> And now you tell me.
5830,Shouldn't somebody like stand guard or something -- just in case? <BR> I'll stay if it'll ease your mind. <BR> You sure? You'll be alright by yourself?
5831,Not a pressing issue. <BR> I tell you the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject? <BR> Uh... gym. <BR> Yes you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why? <BR> Well everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look. <BR> But you enjoyed it yes? <BR> Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler. <BR> Cheerleading.  For... sporting events yes? <BR> Sporting events yeah. <BR> All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer? <BR> Here? <BR> Yes yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer. <BR> Okay.
5832,That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE... <BR> Five this week; how many the week before? <BR> You're as bad as my father. <BR> And the week before that?
5833,I'm tired. I want to go home. <BR> Very well. I shall drop you and go on to the party. I have no intention of missing it...
5834,Bessel!  What are you doing here? <BR> Hi Grueller. <BR> What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared? <BR> Could be. <BR> You think so? <BR> Could be.
5835,Besides what about these...? <BR> That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
5836,I haven't broken any laws. <BR> Then you won't mind if I look around. <BR> I would. <BR> Got something to hide? <BR> Doesn't everybody? <BR> I could get a search warrant. <BR> If you could you would have brought one today.
5837,Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight. <BR> Good evening Mr. Pimenov. <BR> Oh -- good evening Baron. <BR> How's the beautiful lady? <BR> Grusinskaya -- well to tell the truth Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night? <BR> Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances. <BR> Well -- last night was not so good. <BR> I thought she was splendid! <BR> Yes -- but the audience.
5838,Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination. <BR> Serve. <BR> I was trying to educate you. <BR> Just serve. <BR> In the same fashion as chess. <BR> What? <BR> Chess. Chess is often used as well. <BR> Will you shut up and play. <BR> You're a bad loser. <BR> I haven't lost yet.
5839,What's with Mike? <BR> He got a little jealous. <BR> I'm sorry I didn't. <BR> It's okay. Don't worry about it.
5840,Well this is the last time I ever rent here... <BR> You'll be missed. <BR> Screw you!
5841,Five to three. Youre early. <BR> Should I come back in five minutes?
5842,I cannot betray Louis.  I will defend him with my life. <BR> I know.  God go with you.
5843,Hey flower child the sixties are over.  And this stuff is hazardous to your health. <BR> Yes daddy.
5844,Thank God. Oh thank God.  Tommy you didn't *bust* out didya? You ain't got to hide have you? <BR> No Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers.
5845,How did those... ? <BR> You're part of it... <BR> What?  Connie...
5846,Besides Julie wouldn't...she'd never... <BR> Actually Stu Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM. <BR> Nine AM! But that's - <u>twelve hours</u>.
5847,It could just as easily have been me in that box. <BR> I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo. <BR> What about bowling? <BR> Bowling died for me years ago. Besides I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero. <BR> You're a scumbag.
5848,How could you not *care* about the movie? <BR> You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie. <BR> That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie. <BR> Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
5849,Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here. <BR> Your Majesty has had many women -- <BR> That is my desire and my desire is what should concern you not the sentiments of some commoner! <BR> It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own? <BR> What quaint notions d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father who picked his queen when he was old and only then to bear me. <BR> There is more to love than he knew or that you know. <BR> You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?! <BR> Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women and they will love you.  Love yourself and -- <BR> That is enough!  You are a good servant d'Artagnan but you forget your place! <BR> At least help Raoul. <BR> Silence!  I order you! <BR> Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do to protect your own honor! <BR> I will consider it.  Now leave me. <BR> Thank you your Majesty.
5850,How was that? <BR> A little better. <BR> Gimme the God damn ball!
5851,My home number's on the back... <BR> Bud Fox I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
5852,No wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful. <BR> Really? <BR> Swear to God.
5853,That just ain't right Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right. <BR> Them people drinkin' that cider they don't know there's a cigarette in there! <BR> It's not that hard to find it in there Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'. <BR> You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette! <BR> What business is you in Jack? Just tell me what your business is...
5854,So how do you get from the Bronx to the South China sea? <BR> You quit high school lie about your age join the navy and next thing you know four years are up and you need a way to make a living...
5855,Athos!  I know life means nothing to you at this moment but I will not let you kill yourself. <BR> The King killed my son! <BR> The cannons killed Raoul!  The cannons and love.  But not the King.
5856,I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston. <BR> Is that the usual way priests go on vacation? <BR> We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission.. <BR> What kind of mission? <BR> We have to save the world. <BR> Good luck.. <BR> Of course. <BR> Father I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
5857,...are you with the Consulate? <BR> Something like that. Cigarette?
5858,Just come and get me sir.  I'm tired. <BR> Name your vacation spot Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
5859,So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us? <BR> Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions... <BR> If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition... <BR> Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed. <BR> How do we prove it? <BR> Simple. We sedate him induce a somnolesent state and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles. <BR> Then I'd say it's bedtime for Jason.
5860,I wonder if we ought to-- <BR> Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight. <BR> You think it's all right for you to stay here? <BR> I've got a good lock on my door.  And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight.
5861,It'll never wash.  Pardoning them means we're guilty.  The people the press will go nuts. <BR> And what am I supposed to do?  Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center?  Lyndon bugged!  So did Kennedy!  FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me?  What about Lyndon?  He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down.  Did anyone talk to him?
5862,Wow dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you. <BR> I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!! <BR> Good thing she was never your girlfriend... Dude here comes Cartman.
5863,Yeah but you were good you were really good. Fucking bin-bag' I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there. <BR> You think so?
5864,Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead right? <BR> Point-five ...
5865,You just... got off the train because it looked pretty? <BR> Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
5866,"Thank you, Janet...thank you, Mr. Lynch. <BR> No, thank you. I knew the minute I laid eyes on you, you had what it takes Bud. Just keep it going."
5867,Here's to. an interesting experience. <BR> I'll drink to that.
5868,How many rounds did you find for that weapon? <BR> Four counting the one in the chamber. <BR> Don't let it out of your hands again.  Can the kid walk?
5869,Truck. <BR> Truck.  Of course. <BR> '63 Chevy. <BR> I knew it. <BR> So how do you know the owner Mr. Bianchinni? <BR> I don't really.  I was referred to him. <BR> Oh really.
5870,"That twenty-five thousand dollars is money I collected for Nixon in this year's campaign. <BR> I see. And how do you think it reached Miami? <BR> I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine. <BR> That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg."
5871,You got everything you ever wanted. <BR> Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
5872,What happened? <BR> Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
5873,I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession... <BR> I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
5874,Hell yeah. I love. I love sex. <BR> Foreplay. Foreplay.
5875,I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they? <BR> Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers. <BR> I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well congratu-fucking-lations Steven: Round One you win. <BR> Well not quite. See those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited. <BR> Then who are they? <BR> You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac but: bravo. <BR> What are you talking about? You think I invited them? <BR> Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did Evelyn? <BR> It you really loved me Steven you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds. <BR>  <BR> All accidents until proven otherwise.
5876,Taupin Richard Marshall.  Born March 16 1945 in Church Hill Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia. <BR> Church Hill that's pretty close isn't it? <BR> Anything in Maryland is close.
5877,"So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous? <BR> Alone. Alone. I'm here alone. <BR> Where are you staying? <BR> Right here at the hotel. Why? <BR> Well... I thought you might be looking for a date. <BR> A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes. <BR> I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood."
5878,I don't know. Please... <BR> I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now. <BR> No. Don't do this. <BR> I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind. <BR> Robert if that happens you'll have to decide. I won't be able to.
5879,It's because he comes off as the underdog. <BR> Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned or somehow killed to look like an accident. <BR> You don't want to kill him.  If anything happens to him now you will be blamed... and he knows it. Besides that gladiator school is a fortress.  It would take the army to break in there.  What you want is to... offer him the wooden sword. If he takes it he's no longer the champion of the people is he?  He's gone.  And you are a hero for awarding it.
5880,We have to go into that cabin and search it Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt. <BR> I know.  Do you think if something happened it happened there? <BR> Sam if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away to start a new business somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars? <BR> How could we prove...  Well if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say a year from now... <BR> There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way! <BR> What makes you sound so certain? <BR> Arbogast! Sam he liked me... or felt sorry for me... and he was starting to feel the same about you. I heard it when he called... in his voice a caring. He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us.  Unless he was stopped. And he was stopped so he must have found out something!
5881,God bless. <BR> Well uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew. <BR> Oh thank you. <BR> Yeah well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money but let me tell yuh I mean she's the one yeah is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh. <BR> So did you do shoot the photographs in there or what? <BR> Yeah yeah I sorta dabble around you know.
5882,Uh oh.  I remember that temper. <BR> Daniel I didn't hear you come down...
5883,No. <BR> Do you know where she might be? <BR> Certainly not!
5884,New? <BR> Walter just got it back from the framer today.
5885,I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - - <BR> Turn it off Lex!  Turn it off!
5886,Helms wants Iran or there might be problems.  All of his old CIA buddies are over there making a fortune off the Shah. <BR> For God's sake when does this end?!
5887,That is so cool. <BR> Thank you very much. <BR> Nobody is even gonna look at the game.
5888,"You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be. <BR> ...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son."
5889,What do you want? <BR> A little Charlie perhaps. <BR> Coke? <BR> I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants. <BR> That shouldn't be a problem.
5890,Hello. <BR> Linnea? <BR> Yes. Who's this? <BR> I'm here. <BR> Who is this? <BR> Tom. You remember? <BR> I'm not sure. Where? <BR> Remember about a month ago your church choir cut a record? <BR> Yes. <BR> Well I met you that afternoon in the control room and we... <BR> Oh Tom of course. What are you doing in Nashville?
5891,Really? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Split it? <BR> Oh God yes please.  Thanks man. I'll take you up on that. <BR> Where's Christine?  The waitress. <BR> Yeah yeah.  She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane. <BR> Did she?
5892,Motor oil? <BR> For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.
5893,Don't give me any of your shit!  Okay this has always been a dream but we're going. <BR> Lester - he called you here. <BR> Right. <BR> Here. <BR> He was just on the phone. <BR> He called you right here. <BR> I just talked to him. <BR> So he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now. <BR> Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell waiting for me to call him back. Now I - <BR> That's - Yeah he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's - <BR> He's sittin' by the phone - <BR> What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house! <BR> Get your bag! Come on get your bag! Get your things! Let's go! <BR> It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem you know. <BR> Oh what bullshit? What do you want to fuckin' talk it over now? <BR> You're done yakkin' okay? You're done yakkin' now? <BR> Go! Go! Get in the car! Go! <BR> 'Go! Go! Go!'
5894,He can't respond to the Allegations.  I don't care <u>how</u> many girlscouts are picketing the ... look look look we're coming home with <u>Gold</u>.  Eh? Tell him to hold firm for <u>two hours</u>... coming home with Gold. <BR> Did we ever use those costumes for the Border Patrol? Those guys in the Leopard-Skin <u>Hats</u>?  Here's my idea....
5895,You like this house Max? <BR> M'hm. <BR> I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom. <BR> Whee you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party. <BR> What difference does that make?
5896,Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door. <BR> Scratched --  We did not take the initiative. <BR> Of course you took the initiative.
5897,Where from? <BR> Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
5898,It's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course but we're breaking down the old Unitarian barriers -- <BR> I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person -- <BR> Well I of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion -- at times it's the disorganization that's liberating -- and of course I've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments in small groups and one on one couples --
5899,STOP IT! <BR> Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time? <BR> I told you! I won't apologize for who I am. <BR> No one's asking you to! <BR> I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong. <BR> You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony! <BR> I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU! <BR> WHY? <BR> BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU! <BR> WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
5900,Aha! You love him. <BR> It's extremely complicated and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
5901,Here you are. There's people out there. <BR> Hey you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago the Knicks are ahead fourteen points and now...  they're ahead two points. <BR> Alvy what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop? <BR> What's fascinating is that it's physical. You know it's one thing about intellectuals they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on. But on the other hand...  the body doesn't lie as-as we now know.
5902,Is Jenny gonna be okay? <BR> She was wearing a helmet.  It could have been worse. <BR> But is she gonna be okay? <BR> How the hell should I know?
5903,Recent hours have been a shock. <BR> Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been I knew there was something different about me.  But a king... <BR> Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it. <BR> There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother? <BR> The desire for vengeance... can be a poison. <BR> What is its antidote? <BR> I suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison who pass such beauty every day and never see it.
5904,How'd you find this place? <BR> Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
5905,The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy Mr. O'Brien and science is our greatest weapon against her. <BR> You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
5906,It makes me sad. <BR> Can --? <BR> Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
5907,What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything. <BR> [Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me. <BR> If you don't get out of my house right now I'll call the police.
5908,What is it we can do for you today? <BR> Well we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
5909,C'mon. Let me take you home. <BR> No. <BR> Elle -- it's twenty miles back to campus.
5910,Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive. <BR> Second only to unbridled narcissistic conceit. <BR> Why can't you be nice to me? <BR> You've got enough people kissing your ass.
5911,What if it doesn't come back? <BR> I told you.  You need to rest.
5912,You know what I did. <BR> Yeah I know. I'm fishing. <BR> You said --
5913,Will you need me for anything else Lieutenant? <BR> I don't think so Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information we'll be in touch.
5914,It seems like ever since I found out about this guy this name I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something. <BR> I know the feeling. <BR> Yeah...  Well anyway I also wanted to tell you I'm not getting married. <BR> You aren't? <BR> No.  I mean yes I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well actually it was kind of mutual. <BR> Well.  Congratulations. <BR> Thank you.  So since I have a few more days of vacation left I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean you know if you don't have... other plans. <BR> Are you asking me out?
5915,So tell me what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case... <BR> That's their job isn't it?  To argue.  So I think my case will be long on talk and short on action. <BR> I am prepared to write anything you tell me.
5916,Pretty handy with that scatter gun Epps. You raised on a farm? <BR> Seen a lota movies.
5917,And I'd like to point out that I've been on prescription <u>medication</u> the side-effects of which... <BR> I'm doing my job Too.  Would you give me a... do you think you could call off your Dogs for a minute.
5918,Are you looking for a problem? <BR> Everyone keep your voices down!
5919,I'm okay. <BR> Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
5920,Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight after theater. For a bottle of wine. <BR> Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb. <BR> I'm glad Bill's back. <BR> They'd die without each other.
5921,So what? <BR> The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
5922,What? <BR> Are you okay? <BR> Yeah I'm fucking fantastic.
5923,Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is? <BR> Mrs. Thorwald.
5924,It's not mine. <BR> It's not mine either. <BR> It's what you came back for.
5925,Boss! <BR> Yeah? <BR> Boss ain't you going to bed? <BR> Not right now.
5926,We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted so me can forget about the space man for today. <BR> There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us? <BR> Well we could-- <BR> There's always somebody here but today of course they've all got plans.
5927,You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another. <BR> I'll go.  We'll both go.  Far away.
5928,You know the story Gale. Man falsely accused sent to prison proved innocent released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive? <BR> Did you do it?
5929,I like it better when I'm on top. <BR> Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done. <BR> I'm sorry.
5930,But -- are you sure? <BR> We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket for the third time today when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother. <BR> Michelle cannot possibly accept! <BR> She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation the King sent the diamond pendant from the piglet. <BR> Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ? <BR> Never mind Papa it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that. <BR> Die?  What...? <BR> I have rejoined the army and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge. <BR> Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No. <BR> It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave to say goodbye before coming to tell you. <BR> Raoul no... You cannot do this.  No matter how your heart is broken --
5931,You're late Pierce. I know but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls. <BR> No ... <BR> I got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time.  I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise. <BR> What if there is no tomorrow? <BR> Go on get outta here Pierce before I give you a big hug.  I love this guy.
5932,How long will this take? <BR> 'Bout thirty seconds.
5933,It's not here. Let's go. <BR> You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this? <BR> Why not it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something now that you fucked it up. <BR> I wanted to make a statement. <BR> Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy just good. They get in they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom boom boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead. <BR> ...that's a good motto. <BR> Fine I'll get you a bumpersticker but you better start believing it! It's the only statement you need to make.
5934,How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel how would you say it went? <BR> I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
5935,What like some kind of ghost? <BR> I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there the next she was gone.
5936,You wouldn't think jus' reachin' up an' pickin'd get you in the back. <BR> Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me? <BR> No. I'm jus' gonna set awhile an' then go to bed.
5937,Bruce really when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you. <BR> In other words what right do I have to talk about terror. <BR> As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing that's all. <BR> I see.  If I know how you really feel I won't like you as much.
5938,Do you have a note to corroborate these claims? <BR> Um well... <BR> Are you lying to me? <BR> Well... <BR> What did we say about lying? <BR> I'm not lying. <BR> You know that no one likes a liar right? <BR> I said I'm not lying.
5939,"Sexy, hm? What was I before? <BR> Older, sillier. <BR> I don't want to depend on these things, y'know - sometimes you can weaken your eyes."
5940,My daughter Rachel. <BR> Yummy. <BR> Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s. <BR> Really? Care to make a wager on that? <BR> Good luck Sebastian. <BR> What nervous I'm going to win? <BR> Would you please leave.
5941,Your silence intrigues me. <BR> John the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully maybe even.. dangerously but and...well there it is.
5942,I take it your son is not married Mrs Spitz? <BR> No. And before you ask no hes not gay! He has had girlfriends but nothing serious... <BR> Any friends? <BR> The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with Leonards address keys and other things you might need.  <BR> Im sure... As far as you know when and where was your son last seen? <BR> When... Im told he came here...
5943,A twist ending if you will. <BR> Yeah we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu things been done. <BR> ..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience... <BR> And we didnt want to do that Sid. We wanted to give you your moneys worth. <BR> So we found a compromise. <BR> Or it found us. <BR> We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings. <BR> Just for you Sid. <BR> Wait a sec Derek. We forgot to flip.
5944,$250000 right off the top. <BR> Is he straight? <BR> You got the parole didn't you?
5945,Mr... Mr. Hand. <BR> That's right Jeff. Mind if I come in?
5946,Thanks. He knows I love this although why it couldn't have waited... <BR> Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two pack some clothes and his precious saxophone. <BR> How long's he staying for? <BR> Search me. I guess we're abandoned.
5947,At your service sir. <BR> Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me Merlin: have we defeated evil as it seems? <BR> Good and evil; there is never one without the other.
5948,The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars that's L-A-R-S Lars Thorwald. <BR> What's the apartment house number? <BR> 125 West Ninth Street.
5949,Well...How have you been? <BR> Well they removed my heart last week but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.
5950,He's on his way. <BR> He can follow the breadcrumbs right? <BR> Right.
5951,What are you going to do to him? <BR> Do?  Well I suppose that depends on you.
5952,How did you come to know their names? <BR> You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now Dr. Becker. <BR> I don't understand... <BR> I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to huh Dr. Becker. It turned out different didn't it? <BR> I didn't put you in Alpine Grove. <BR> No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket.
5953,I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come? <BR> Nah. <BR> What you been up to? <BR> Nothing.
5954,Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again! <BR> What is Terrance and Phillip? <BR> Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children! <BR> Well it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
5955,Caesar! <BR> Gino your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
5956,But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you. <BR> He knows me? <BR> He says he saw you in a vision some time ago.
5957,Anyone stops us going in we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples. <BR> Rug samples. <BR> We are one-dimensional boring peddlers of fine carpet Carl.
5958,I oughtn't to presume but I --  I'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous. The first time in my life I have gambled -- I've danced! Oh you can laugh gentlemen but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life! <BR> Splendid!
5959,I did my box work but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean I'm with you on this Conklin was a nut but a traitor? I just can't get there. <BR> What do you have Danny? <BR> You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know is if it's gonna blow the room with it. <BR> And? <BR> There were two charges they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one the one that didn't go off was down here...  First of all this is nothing it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know. <BR> It was staged? <BR> Is it a slam dunk? No but... <BR> Jesus... <BR> Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this? <BR> Keep going... <BR> Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin? <BR> Lots of people... <BR> Including Landy...  She had access to the archives.
5960,If you're not with me Violet then I have to assume you're against me. <BR> Caesar this is crazy. <BR> Maybe it is maybe it isn't.  Maybe you dropped the Scotch by accident. Maybe you didn't.
5961,"See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you. <BR> Not according to the men in blue. <BR> What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states. <BR> They want to discredit you -- for what? <BR> For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth. <BR> You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why. <BR> You know my work? <BR> Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government -- <BR> I don't either, but it sure sells books."
5962,I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath and swore ourselves to secrecy! <BR> It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!
5963,He's here. <BR> You should pay as fast as you collect you know.
5964,The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago.  He killed nine people didn't he? <BR> Nine that we know of. Two didn't die. <BR> What happened to them? <BR> One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver. <BR> What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor? <BR> Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him. <BR> What would you call him?
5965,How's it going Kam? <BR> You're a week early. <BR> I was in the neighborhood.
5966,My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well? <BR> Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin.
5967,"....beautiful. <BR> Of course, we're gonna need some <u>water</u>, uh... <BR> Is it a <u>stream</u>, or is it a... <BR> No, I think.. <BR>  <BR> No I think it's ... can we see the calico <u>kitten</u>...?"
5968,And this is my good friend and companion Miss Birdie Coonan. <BR> Oh brother. <BR> Miss Coonan...
5969,Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange. <BR> I'm glad it's you and not Donovan. <BR> He means well. He's really brilliant and all.
5970,I liked being with you last night. <BR> . same here.
5971,Want to work? <BR> Sure but what is this? <BR> That's not your affair. Name. <BR> Joad. <BR> How many men? <BR> Four. <BR> Women? <BR> Two. <BR> Kids? <BR> Two. <BR> Can all of you work? <BR> Why I guess so. <BR> Okay. House 63. Wages 5 cents a box. No bruised fruit. Move along and go to work right away.
5972,Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive. <BR> You're sick. <BR> And if you think you can fuck me don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money! <BR> Not a prayer. <BR> I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain in stormy gale force wind tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark! <BR> You need help.
5973,"A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge. <BR> I'm okay... <BR> Fasten the pole."

So things didn't work out huh? <BR> And then I and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now. <BR> Well they're a good outfit. <BR> Yah if you're an engineer yah you could do a lot worse. Of course it's not uh it's nothin' like your achievement. <BR> It sounds like you're doin' really super. <BR> Yah well I uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away.

5975,Like you and Gordon? <BR> Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me. <BR> Yeah he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him. <BR> Right!
5976,"Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read! <BR> A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!"
5977,You know what Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die. <BR> Huh... Im sure thered be lots of takers. <BR> Could someone have hurt you that bad?
5978,No whistles but a Club You bring a hack -- ? <BR> No. Open her ...
5979,Alvy. <BR> Oh hi Duane how's it goin'? <BR> This is my room. <BR> Oh yeah?  Terrific. <BR> Can I confess something?
5980,Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it! <BR> Oh -- I almost forgot!
5981,What? <BR> This... ?  Oh this is just... this is the bill.
5982,"God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now? <BR> Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked. <BR> I wish my funbags would get bigger. <BR> Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode. <BR> Hot!"
5983,Franny? <BR> Hmm? <BR> I just want to say... I know you had your own dreams. I'm sorry I couldn't give them to you. I love you so much.
5984,Family? Family? Friends? Drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups don't have families David. <BR> I just thought we should discuss it. <BR> Take his legs.
5985,John.  John you all right? <BR> Longbranch...? <BR> What?
5986,Scream. <BR> Ah. <BR> Louder. <BR> Aaagh! Rape! <BR> Oh thanks.
5987,If I'm so all-used-up Ben why do you try to hook me up non-stop? <BR> As fucking if.
5988,Want a bite? <BR> No thanks. <BR> That's why you're having them. Your spells. <BR> Spells? Jesus James you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells. <BR> What would you call them then? <BR> I don't know... 'Episodes.'
5989,Sounds like the hull. <BR> Warm water current maybe making the metal expand.
5990,Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist. <BR> Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
5991,She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's. <BR> Let's see it. <BR> I gave it back to her.
5992,Ha ha oh I love you too. <BR> See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights Potato Head.
5993,I never heard of a 908. <BR>  <BR> Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser. <BR> Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that. <BR> Rich people.  Home port is Newport Rhode Island. <BR> If I had a $100000 boat I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel. <BR> If you had a $100000 boat there'd be an investigation.
5994, <BR> ...can we have a white one...? <BR> Can we have a white one please...
5995,State of grace and all that. <BR> Tradition. <BR> It's all we have.
5996,So William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale. <BR> That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference. <BR> Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof! <BR> The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning exposé changed all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up.
5997,Hi. <BR> Hi there. <BR> Is that your car? <BR> It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --
5998,Do you see that? Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. I know we're supposed to avoid each other but you know there's ways to do things and there's ways not to. <BR> Yeah. Fuck him.
5999,Do something! <BR> Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
6000,See her?  Get anything? <BR> For the paper no; for us plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me we talked awhile. <BR> And?--And?-- <BR> --she was panicked Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate you could tell. <BR> Were you eyebrow reading? <BR> It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?
6001,The porno mags? <BR> Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties. <BR> Here. Now leave me alone. <BR> Uh can I have the other one. The one below this one. They show more in that one.
6002,I...uh... <BR> No speeches Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared.  What are you waiting for?
6003,Good day sir.  I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well? <BR> He's feeling wonderful. <BR> Thanks be to God. <BR> And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford? <BR> Not so well I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say... <BR> Buying her? <BR> This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner... <BR> I understand.  How much?
6004,Know the name? <BR> 'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders. <BR> Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight. <BR> I remember that deal. You were involved?
6005,Where to? <BR> To see a man about a thing. <BR> I can do that.
6006,What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING? <BR> Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! 
6007,But just for the record my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent a legacy for us. Their kids. <BR> I didn't forget. <BR> 
6008,Good.  Good.  That's terrific... <BR> What? <BR> If ya get in a fight with some asshole never hit his with your pitching hand.  ya might get injured.  That's another lesson for ya--now quit fucking around and help me up.
6009,Do I look all right? <BR> None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you. <BR> I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused... <BR> Perhaps this will help.
6010,Shall I leave? <BR> No you may wait behind the screen.
6011, <BR> How nice. You remembered. But of course that was the day the Germans marched into Paris. <BR> Not an easy day to forget. <BR> No. <BR> I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray you wore blue. <BR> Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out I'll wear it again.
6012,Well you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'? <BR> Don't hold me so tight. <BR> Why I ain't hardly touchin' you! <BR> You're *ticklin' me!* <BR> That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.* <BR> Now I can't breathe.
6013,She was magnificent. <BR> Then you've heard too. <BR> I was there. An eyewitness. <BR> You were there? At the play - last night? <BR> A happy coincidence.
6014,No Captain please. <BR> No. Please Monsieur it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
6015,Father by creating a little destruction I am in fact encouraging life!  So in reality you and I are in the same business! <BR> Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another. <BR> Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
6016,...Im Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this thats who I am. Do you get what Im fucking saying Mr Lombard? <BR> What about your friendly cop? <BR> My ex-husband. My work drove him away. Made his life a misery. He thinks Im obsessed punishing myself for what happened to our son.  But hes a good guy. Hell listen to you. He wont turn you in if I ask him not to. I can pretty much guarantee that. Okay?
6017,No I don't.  I'm not Jack ... <BR> But they never will Dick.  No matter how many elections you win they never will.
6018,"Would somebody wake me in five minutes? <BR> Does it <u>have</u> to be Albania?  Because, lookit:  I can get my hands on a lot of walking-around-cash, I think, if it's <u>Italy</u>...Look at the tie-in here:  <u>The</u> <u>Boot</u>, Givvem the <u>Boot</u>... If we were to go Wide with a <u>shoe</u> as the fad.  A Shoe-fad""""...  Here's what it offers us..."" <BR> We're locked into Albania. <BR> Well, let's not be too sure, why is that? <BR> The President is going to declare War against Albania in a half an hour."
6019,Yes ... you know it!  Yes ... I will. Yeah! <BR> Then I'll be there for you. <BR> You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you Buddy. <BR> Can I just ask for one thing? <BR> Anything. <BR> Will you ... would you kiss me?
6020,What are you doing on the reservation? <BR> I'm on my way back in. Over.
6021,You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off man. <BR> The good news Jack is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*... <BR> Yeah that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.
6022,Now then let's run through it one more time shall we?  What's your job? <BR> I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice relaying that information to you. <BR> Next.
6023,Hello. <BR> I -- I thought you were-- <BR> I was. <BR> You mean he has the power of life and death? <BR> No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit. <BR> This technique in certain cases can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people. <BR> But how -- how long--? <BR> How long will I live?  That no one can say.
6024,The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo? <BR> Go catch Jimmy Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead go get him. I'm late. <BR> Hey. Hey those are my sunglasses you're wearing. <BR> Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
6025,What year are you in? <BR> I'm what you would call a fifth year senior. <BR> But I thought high school is only four years. <BR> It is unless you're a fuck up like myself.
6026,No.  I'm quite certain you can't. <BR> Look we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon where we can sit for two days in the open next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive or we can head for the village where we might find some shelter and we can call for help. <BR> We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me I have some experience in this matter.
6027,The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it. <BR> There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good. <BR> The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing. <BR> Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change.  Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon.  They were real enough once but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day.
6028,You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog. <BR> But what happens when they do find out? <BR> Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like uh from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it they take your application they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years don't have a license. <BR> It's a tough proposition Andy. You you know if I did it I'd have to run it my way. <BR> You got it. <BR> I'm serious. No interference. <BR> Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino. I guarantee it.
6029,You're an easy man to track Ray. Ya walk like a penguin with a hard-on. <BR> Is that right? What are the trees saying today? <BR> They're sayin' that nobody's gonna talk to you cuz they don't give away one of their own. But they did say there's somebody way across the Little Walking River who wants to talk to you.
6030,I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name? <BR> Max.
6031,You told him I was throwing a deuce right? <BR> Yep.  He really crushed that dinger didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
6032,What about bats?  Do they turn into bats? <BR> No.  No bats no flying.  They... float occasionally.  Not really flying. <BR> Toasty.  Were there ever any like famous vampires? <BR> Oh several.  Lucretia Borgia Joseph Mengele Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar? <BR> If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person? <BR> Good Lord.  What do you study in history? <BR> My nails.
6033,Jesus Christ Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing? <BR> Look you tell me to take pictures I take pictures. <BR> Let me explain something to you Walsh. This business requires a certain finesse.
6034,Gettin' kind of tense aren't you? <BR> Oh uh Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm curious.  What does a Space Ranger actually do?
6035,I'm never going back! <BR> No I think your mother her illness -- <BR> It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother. <BR> I don't know Dickie I'm just telling you what I -- <BR> Go back! Go back to New York or call him if you can find a telephone that works and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me back to him or his shipyard.
6036,Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps. <BR> Is it cold?
6037,Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat! <BR> You know exactly where they are!
6038,Bobby -- have you a flashlight? <BR> Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
6039,Of course. Aunt Joan. <BR> And co. A lot of co. Oh God I've thought about you so much. <BR> I've thought about you.
6040,Would you like something to drink? <BR> What are you having? <BR> Iced tea. <BR> Yeah. Fine thank you.
6041,Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.] <BR> I speak English.
6042,Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat? <BR>  <BR> That's what I thought.
6043,Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless. <BR> Probably flunking nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them. <BR> There's a poison in the upper classes Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars too many color TVs ... <BR> Don't forget the South sir the West. Filled with the good football colleges straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts. <BR> It's the parents' fault really.
6044,Not disintegrating Alan -- digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out the molecules go back into place and...  voila. <BR> Great. Can it send me to Hawaii? <BR> Yes...but you have to go roundtrip and you must purchase your program at least 30 days in advance. Hah!
6045,Quint...? <BR> No...  You think we can get back with those?
6046,We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA Bob and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much and if he goes public it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about. <BR> All right. <BR> Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors bizarre without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI call Pat Gray and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky period! <BR> The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw-up.  How does that threaten us? <BR> Just do what I say Bob. <BR> Yes sir but ... do you think Gray'll go for it? <BR> Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him. <BR> He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself. <BR> Christ you're right -- Gray makes Jerry Ford look like Mozart.  Just have Helms call him.  Helms can scare anybody. <BR> The only problem with that sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice. <BR> It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security. <BR> How is this national security? <BR> Because the President says it is.  My job is to protect this country from its enemies and its enemies are inside the walls.
6047,...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it. <BR> You know I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
6048,She's not here. <BR> Where is she? <BR> She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.
6049,Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high. <BR> From the looks of Davidson's cable it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there. <BR> This could go off in a month -- or an hour. <BR> I'll pull somebody out of Japan. <BR> Bryce the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies. <BR> Jefferies? <BR> Name me a better photographer. <BR> But his leg! <BR> Don't worry -- it comes off today.
6050,What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome?  I can end this madness now!  Take the job for the sake of the Gods live! <BR> Can you stop that slaughter?!  Can you free these men?
6051,To infinity and beyond! <BR> Oh all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at uh oh Pizza Planet? <BR> Pizza Planet?!  Oh cool!
6052,I know it's a dream. <BR> You do? <BR> I only dream about people who are dead.
6053,What did you do? <BR> Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...
6054,Good thing one of us was prepared. <BR> Buffy there's no way you're going out there alone.
6055,He one of them? <BR> No that's Noel. Used to be a regular off and on hasn't been in in a while. He seized and almost coded--I gave him a hypertonic solution. He drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt. One for the textbooks.
6056,Maybe you better hear what I got to say first. <BR> Whatever you say Boss. <BR> No Al. Whatever we say. We're all Bosses here. We don' need another.
6057,Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town! <BR> Crawl! <BR> Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house my money my truck -- stolen! <BR> I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
6058,But you haven't any actual proof and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now. <BR> Ricky I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape -- <BR> -- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo? <BR> Because one you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two you have the letters of transit now don't bother to deny it. And well you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact I don't like him either. <BR> Well they're all excellent reasons. <BR> Don't count too much on my friendship Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides I might lose ten thousand francs. <BR> You're not very subtle but you are effective. I I get the point. Yes I have the letters but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane the last plane. <BR> Huh? <BR> And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate. <BR> What friend? <BR> Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America. <BR> You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?
6059,Can I go with you today? <BR> You stay with Mrs. Silvera Tootsie. Okay?
6060,No. <BR> Is he married? <BR> No. <BR> Is he gay? <BR> I don't know.  I don't think so. <BR> So?... <BR> So he's not my type.  Let me walk you to the elevator.
6061,Know what? <BR> You described the exact contents of my purse. <BR> I just took a shot at it.
6062,This is Will Graham. Can I help you? <BR> No. I can help you. <BR> I don't understand. <BR> Atlanta and Birmingham.
6063,"And you think we got a chance to find her? <BR> An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth."
6064,We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there... <BR> I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere... <BR> Well we have to help her!
6065,You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition. <BR> I'll die either way.
6066,Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww goddammit! <BR> I'm sorry.  It was an accident.
6067,Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards... <BR> Wait! Before we put a message out do a search on the word 'clitoris'. <BR> Okay...
6068,Oh baby I can't believe you're back. <BR> Home sweet home huh? Actually I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in anyway?
6069,I want what's mine half the money. We get rid of Mickey no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes I understand. <BR> Yes I understand. <BR> Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy in the waiting room but stay on the phone until I come out. <BR> Sure Gino sure.
6070,I knew him. <BR> Soon he'll be a plastic cube. <BR> Shut up.
6071,I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio? <BR> You name it I paint there. <BR> Well I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card. <BR> You want a drink?
6072,The Senate is out to sink you.  I swear it Caesar your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor.  Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you. <BR> How can they?  Who else is there?  I have no heir...
6073,What about them? <BR> They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
6074,Bravo young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely don't thank me. <BR> You warm my heart.
6075,I want to come home of course I do I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me. <BR> Let him trust Quintus. <BR> Quintus is overly idealistic. <BR> I never knew a more idealistic man than you. <BR> Me?  Well I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen how people outside the empire treat each other. <BR> I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen... <BR> What you don't want to imagine is the things I've done.
6076,You think we're being set up?--Christ Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names. <BR> It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon. <BR> You think this was Clawsen's initiation? <BR> Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
6077,All street mimes should be executed. <BR> ... Looks like a convention.
6078,How long ago? <BR> About an hour maybe two.  Let's see -- I came on about eight....
6079,Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you cant satisfy him? <BR> You... You are out of order Mr Lombard. I... <BR> You what Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?
6080,Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up and put back again. <BR> It could be -- the knife and the saw.
6081,You know Mr. Chairman at Harvard I used your writings in my class. <BR> What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing. <BR> But your writings have changed the world Mr. Chairman. <BR> Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret. <BR> Secret Mr. Chairman? <BR> How a fat man gets so many girls.
6082,"Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty? <BR> I'll go to the Hospital. <BR> What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be? <BR> Like Rome? <BR> Worse. <BR> You made out alright. <BR> Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived..."
6083,What's that? <BR> You're going to the Soho Grand hotel right? <BR> I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant. <BR> Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked? <BR> Nah. <BR> Traveling light. I like that.
6084,Take me somewhere. <BR> What? <BR> Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here. <BR> How about Italy? <BR> Yes. <BR> How about Bari? <BR> Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train. <BR> Have you ever been to that station? <BR> Yes. <BR> You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
6085,Walter. <BR> Do you have many friends? <BR> No. <BR> How come? <BR> A long time ago I was sent far away. When they let me come back all my friends were gone. <BR> It sounds like you were banished. <BR> Banished... yeah. <BR> Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical but they are. Birds know I watch them but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them. <BR> Robin? <BR> Yes? <BR> Would you like to sit on my lap?
6086,I have to go back. Or it'll never stop. <BR> What are you talking... <BR> I've got to finish it. <BR> Finish what?
6087,Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan. <BR> Take us right to Kennedy. Now.
6088,You're so easy. <BR> Gotta keep an eye on her that's all. <BR> Yeah what for? <BR> Keep her from gettin' in trouble that's all.
6089,You just ripped my card in two! <BR> Yes. <BR> Hey bud. What's your problem?
6090,What is it? <BR>  <BR> I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes. <BR> You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen.
6091,I'm not breathing right. <BR> You're not breathing right? <BR> Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded dizzy and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes.
6092,Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K. <BR> Shut up.  Cupcake. Please. Inside.
6093,Oh come on-I mean I was still younger. <BR> Hey that was last year.
6094,Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow or tomorrow night he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin. <BR> That's a childish bullying stunt Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon so you can put away your picture.
6095,Thanks. I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital. <BR> I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure. <BR> It stings a little. <BR> A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.
6096,The don't.  You kind of wish they would though. <BR> Wit-tay. <BR> I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny. <BR> Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish. <BR> Hey wait a minute...
6097,Listen.  Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here you know?  I mean you're my wife for chrissakes. Uh I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think - <BR> You know what Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here.  I am.
6098,Perhaps the police? <BR> I know cops -- and you're no cop.
6099,Take care. <BR> Hey do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could -- <BR> Um -- <BR> Never mind. Sorry that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night Joel.
6100,You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island! <BR> What do you want to do Ian lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
6101,The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep. <BR> Good luck.
6102,Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage. <BR> So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops. <BR> It could have been worse John.  It could have been a lot worse.
6103,"If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it. <BR> Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying! <BR> Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales. <BR> I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history... <BR> Somebody has to pay for that error. And it's not me."
6104,Don't know. <BR> Dominick said they're in the motel? <BR> Yeah either that or in the fuckin' bank. I don't know. They're all over the joint.
6105,No...  it's just very important that I find him okay? <BR> Why? <BR> Because.
6106,I need to know what I'm working with; what their boundaries are. Their lives depend on it and for that matter so does yours.  We've got to bring them together.  Make them a crew.  We're as strong as our weakest link and I don't want to find that out the hard way.  So I will challenge them and they will come together. <BR> Yes sir. <BR> You know the best thing about being a Skipper is the worst thing.  It's all my responsibility.  So I'll tell you what George you stay off of my bridge and I'll stay out of your galley.  We'll get along that way.
6107,What have you seen before?  This is nothing.  Seaweed.  Mud.  Some- thing in the lens. <BR> My ass!
6108,Youre not playing with little boys now scumbag. Where is the Austrian? <BR> Jee... Fuck... Youre fucking mad!
6109,It's a swell idea Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act huh? <BR> Well from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back have her say she's sorry and then your play's over.
6110,What's this guy's problem? <BR> Just go around him.
6111,Bill... Bill it's your birthday. <BR> And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot at twelve midnight...?
6112,Your Honor Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars. <BR> Huh! <BR> My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price. They wanted this cleared up in court. They want their vindication. I agree with them. But for today the offer stands. Before we begin the publicity of a trial. For today only.  When I walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way.
6113,Hello. Hello. <BR> Who was it? <BR> Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling from the days when I had such a thing. <BR> Are you all right? <BR> No. <BR> Then let's spend some money.
6114,I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night. <BR> Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams? <BR> Oh yeah tell everyone I'm crazy. Beauty ida.
6115,We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything. <BR> Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working right?
6116,The knights of Galys approach the camp. It would be politic... <BR> ...to ride out and meet them.
6117,But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press. <BR> If I had there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory. <BR> I see.  So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?
6118,Do you want to take a quick swim? <BR> Well... <BR> Brad probably has some trunks you can borrow... I'm going to my room to change!
6119,I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies. <BR> Movies? <BR> Yes I photograph very well. Look --
6120,The Chinese close in five minutes. Beef lo mein. It's  been on my mind since I woke. Whatjathink? <BR> I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job. <BR> Turn here. You missed it. The Chink is on 3rd.
6121,You were right about the telephones. There are no lines there's some problem. <BR> Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans? <BR> Back I suppose slowly as I can.
6122,We've had this conversation already Daniel. <BR> All I'm saying is that the companies that have money for the kind of research you're interested in have money because that's what they're interested in!  Money!
6123,I miss Tommi so much. <BR> So do I believe me. <BR> Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before? <BR> Maybe different.  I don't know Ellen. <BR> If we stand a chance at all it's only by sticking together.
6124,I don't have time for all this shit!  Just handle it Bob!  Keep it out of the White House.  What else? Kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna throw a tantrum again if I don't see him threatening to quit ... again.  <BR> Well sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still you see on our White House payroll. <BR> Who?  Not another goddamn Cuban?
6125,Sure you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy? <BR> Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world pal.
6126,This thing's going nowhere. <BR> If this is someone's idea of a joke --
6127,Oh you have my body. <BR> Yeah but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing. <BR> Well I need grass and so do you. <BR> Well it ruins it for me if you have grass  because you know I'm like a comedian- <BR> M'hm. <BR> so if I get a laugh from a person who's high it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'. <BR> Were you always funny? <BR> Hey what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.
6128,And what did you do? <BR> I got out of there. <BR> Found what?
6129,C'mon Tim move down damn it! <BR> Timmy!  The power is coming down quick!
6130,Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did. <BR> And look what happened.
6131,"My husband tells me you're in sharks. <BR> I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks. <BR> You love sharks? <BR> I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere."
6132,Your voice -- it's so familiar ... <BR> We have met ...
6133,You care about him don't you? <BR> We've got a good arrangement that's all. Whistler makes the weapons I use them the vampires die -- end of story.
6134,I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore. <BR> Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
6135,Hi. <BR> Hello. <BR> I'm Opal. <BR> Oh yes I'm John Triplette. <BR> I'm gathering information about the characteristics of music people. I just finished a documentary on Gandi.
6136,So what are we waiting for? <BR> What? <BR> Let's face it.  You want me.
6137,I'm afraid she's something of a gossip isn't she? <BR> I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care. <BR> That I will indeed.
6138,"Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race. <BR> That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy -- <BR> Imagine our surprise when they began to gestate. My group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists, facilitating their programs. To give us access to the virus. In false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure. So that we might save ourselves, as the last of the species.  Your father wisely refused to believe this, choosing hope over selfishness. Hope is the only future he had: his children,  The only future any of us have."
6139,The right nostril.  Good. <BR> My right nostril? <BR> 
6140,"I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's... <BR> You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!"
6141,Mother's ring.  I can't take this. <BR> She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
6142,You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos. <BR> Oh sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent - <BR> I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again. <BR> <u>Why</u>?? <BR> I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her. <BR> I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>. <BR> Death I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour. <BR> Well - you'd need a body.
6143,All the same someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there. <BR> No Rick. No you see Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was even when I knew you in Paris.
6144,How is it any different? <BR> It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.  Because you know it's there we don't have to go to it we don't have to deal with it but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.
6145,Who's this? <BR> It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together. <BR> Okay.  And did we know each other? <BR> Well I knew you so I suppose you must have known me. <BR> Princeton is like a fog America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry what was it? <BR> Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.
6146,Beverly Center. <BR> Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
6147,You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him! <BR> David? You call your teacher David? <BR> It's his name. <BR> Well listen that's a nice bi-it's a biblical name. Right? W-What does he call you? Bathsheba?
6148,We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head. <BR> Playing?
6149,Parking permits... <BR> Are your parking permits in the computer? He drives a van.
6150,Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely. <BR> An embezzler -- you're going to take that back right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt if I'm dirt you're a lot dirtier Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing. <BR> You're discharged. <BR> Me? <BR> Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get out -- you're discharged.
6151,Mr Lombard... <BR> How are you Mrs De Moraes? <BR> When did you get back? <BR> Why dont you ask when I left the Mondrian?
6152,Jesus youre just as whacked as your son. <BR> Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.
6153,Mr. Mulder. <BR> What happened to Kurtzweil? <BR> He's come and gone.
6154,Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love. <BR> Who says I don't love him?...
6155,I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery. <BR> Commentary. <BR> Oh really I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery. <BR> No jokes-these are friends okay?
6156,You gotta stop thinking like that. <BR> Then where are you going? <BR> Nowhere. [Beat] I just think I'm gonna be sick.
6157,And how does one go about getting these human documents may I inquire? <BR> That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti!  <BR> Quick Watson the cookbook!
6158,We've decided Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much. <BR> Well good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?
6159,Here Theo it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing. <BR> I'm not here to - I can't...
6160,Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners. <BR> Whose side are you on anyway? <BR> Now don't get excited Mr. Alexander. They'll scatter like a covey of quail.
6161,Get in the basement. <BR> What? <BR> Get everyone down in the basement.
6162,"I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state. <BR> Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure..."
6163,Well nobody put a gun to his head. <BR> Oh shut up! It's the woman who's in control of these situations. Men don't know which end is up till a woman points.
6164,Uh hello? <BR> WB2YKXB who've I got? <BR> Name's John.
6165,Yeah  for the criminally insane.  I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp that's where he spends most of his time... <BR> Where is it? <BR> I don' t know. It's someplace down in there....  ..deep.. A big door...a wheel....
6166,He'll have to run. <BR> If he runs everyone will assume he took the money. <BR> You'll be clean and we'll be rich.
6167,Are you by nature a sadistic person? <BR> No I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well you know the whole world is just going nuts.
6168,How do they know that? How can they know any of that? <BR> What is this a game? <BR> I want to hear it from you.
6169,I just want you there in case there's trouble. <BR> And if there is then Zero can kill someone? <BR> We'll see.
6170,Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this you're with a winner. <BR> ...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk it's obvious. <BR> Excuse me sir.
6171,"Who's that young man? <BR> Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute. <BR> I think we all owe a debt of gratitude to these men for catching this monster."
6172,It's like farming. I am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks and George Clair has obviously in the mere two years since he joined the firm he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department -- <BR> Ben-- <BR> Yeah? <BR> You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another. <BR> You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right. <BR> You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon. <BR> Gotcha.
6173,"Do you think? Maybe we should call someone -- <BR> The phone's out. <BR> Yeah. Well, we can just -- <BR> Ben, I don't think he wants us here."
6174,Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie. <BR> Read me some?
6175,I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests right? Then I got these ISDN numbers right? Then I tracked them back right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest right? Then I called back see they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company right? So now they're sharing it with me right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want. <BR> So what's in there -- ? <BR> 
6176,Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him. <BR> Maybe he was a lousy shot.
6177,Frank take it easy. what happened? <BR> He flipped out.
6178,You're just gonna walk? <BR> Yeah I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
6179,The truth is if you've had money your entire life even if you despise it which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it. <BR> I know. <BR> I've never admitted that to anyone.
6180,Hey!  Uh how do I get back in? <BR> Carefully tough guy.  Very carefully. <BR> My name's Johnny Utah! <BR> Who cares! <BR> I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him.
6181,"I agree. Go thou and sin no more. <BR> I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it. <BR> Thanks, buddy, buddy, I'm back. Say, Buddy, those optorectomies do work wonders."
6182,"Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you. <BR> Come again? <BR> You were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her. But it amused me to make you ashamed of it. You gave up on the first person you ever loved because I called you names. Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand, I never loved you, Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little toy I play with. And now you've completely blown it with her. I think that's the saddest thing I've ever heard.  Cheers."
6183,Who is thin? <BR> Who is this?  It's Tom. <BR> I don't know who you are. <BR> What do you mean?  You said you wanted to see me.
6184,"I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it... <BR> One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out... <BR> It wasn't much of a letter... <BR> No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something... <BR> But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie... <BR> It isn't fair..."
6185,He's fine. He's narrating. <BR> We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time.
6186,Laurence! <BR> I was hired by your parents Mrs De Moraes.
6187,Give me the short version. <BR> Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--
6188,It is not arguing to speak the truth. <BR> Listen to me my blood somehow... helped you.  It could help all of you.  We could find some way to --
6189,So you see the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think? <BR> Oh man I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie. <BR> Eric you're not watching your mouth! <BR> You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch and I'll watch my fucking mouth! <BR> Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you! <BR> Help yourself prickfuck! <BR> I am not a prickfuck mkay? You little asshole!
6190,What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake? <BR> They're yellow. <BR> Well I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby God willing we can create a more decisive palette. <BR> Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom. <BR> I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area... <BR> Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls. <BR>  <BR> Nesting huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva? <BR>  <BR> I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion. <BR> And I disagree.
6191,Got it! <BR> What now? <BR> Hang on. I have to leave a message.
6192,Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period? <BR> U.S. History. Mr. Hand. <BR> Hey-yo.
6193,Who gives a shit about aft? <BR> That's where my boat's moored. <BR> You trying to take over my show Finnegan that what you trying to do? <BR> Just trying to get to my boat...
6194,Or somebody stopped them. <BR> Either way they must've had a pretty good reason.
6195,Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment are you? <BR> Of course. <BR> Yeah bu-bu-but why? <BR> Well I mean I'm moving in with you that's why. <BR> Yeah but you-you got a nice apartment. <BR> I have a tiny apartment. <BR> Yeah I know it's small. <BR> That's right and it's got bad plumbing and bugs. <BR> All right granted it has bad plumbing and bugs but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know bugs are-are-uh entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field. <BR> You don't want me to live with you? <BR> How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it? <BR> Mine. <BR> Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually but uh I approved it immediately. <BR> I guess you think that I talked you into something huh?  <BR> No-what what...? I... we live together we sleep together we eat together. Jesus you don't want it to be like we're married do yuh?
6196,How's that? Can you hear me better now? <BR> Yes Mr. Zorg I hear you perfectly! So how was the concert? <BR> Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone. <BR> Yes Sir! <BR> Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine. <BR> Right away Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel. <BR> I'm not at the hotel!
6197,Well well well! Gallagher old pal! There you are. What did you run away for? <BR> I didn't run away.
6198,Chill man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment! <BR> Oh man you a FINE nigga! You know that? <BR> Cut it out man! And don't be callin' me that shit!
6199, <BR> Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't... <BR> Cancel lunch.  Make reservations at Campton Place for me and Mr. Butts.
6200,I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her. <BR> I'll do my best.
6201,I was thinking about that story you told me about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after. <BR> Yeah. <BR> I hate to disappoint you but I don't think it happened. <BR> Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it? <BR> It may have happened but not the way you said. <BR> You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that? <BR> It wasn't me. I wasn't there but I heard about it. When I heard about it it was about Elbourne. <BR> We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him. <BR> And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft. <BR> Well I never heard that one. <BR> I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence. <BR> That's what you think.
6202,Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers you got that!! <BR> Alright alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know?
6203,I thought she'd get a kick out of it. <BR> It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy? <BR> Larry you've got to tell her. <BR> I can't tell her.  She's called off her wedding.  She'll never speak to me again.
6204,Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized. <BR> If you want to hire me I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about. <BR> Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl. <BR> How did you find out? <BR> I've still got a few teeth in my head Mr. Gittes and a few friends in town. <BR> Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl or what Evelyn might do to her? <BR> Just find the girl. <BR> I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves. <BR> Avocado groves? <BR> We'll be in touch Mr. Cross.
6205,"Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie -- <BR> No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you? <BR> I married a car salesman."
6206,Say you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain haven't you? <BR> You weren't so bad yourself. <BR>  <BR>  <BR>  <BR> How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story? <BR> No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe. <BR> Oh you are! Who made you the manager? <BR> I did! It was my idea wasn't it? <BR> You always want to run everything. <BR> If you don't like it you can resign from the company. <BR> I refuse to resign! <BR> Then I'll fire you. I'll do all the parts myself.
6207,Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals? <BR> You scare me Charlie. <BR> Maybe that's why I'm the Boss.
6208,You got that shit face? Asina... <BR> KNOCK IT OFF!
6209,Probably on his way back right now. <BR> Sam I'm going. <BR> You'll never find it.
6210,Open the door will ya? <BR> Why don't you quit now you want out so bad? <BR> Open the door. We're late. <BR> I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up Jack and you're digging wells in the snow. <BR> What do you mean I got money? I'm as broke as you.
6211,But O'Brien doesn't even use that office.  The Democrats've moved to Miami.  There's nothing there! <BR> It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC. <BR> Their fourth! <BR> It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money. <BR> Contributions!  It was a legal contribution.  Who the hell authorized this?  Colson?
6212,How long will he need to be asleep? <BR> We're going to need at least two full REM cycles to get a clear neurological profile. Three hours minimum six hours ideal.
6213,Oh yes Mr. Preysing? <BR> Sit here.  Cognac -- for you? <BR> Nothing.
6214,What'll it be Auggie? <BR> Uh...  My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.
6215,She stole some money. <BR> A lot? <BR> Forty thousand dollars. <BR> And the police haven't been able to...
6216,"Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there... <BR> Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access..."
6217,Someone tried to kill me. <BR> The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
6218,The financials are pretty thorough so the only thing we don't know is your fee. <BR> ...My fee? Wade what the heck're you talkin' about?
6219,Kate is that you? <BR> Uh huh. <BR> I didn't expect you back so soon.
6220,Sam.  I'm a weapons guy. <BR> You were a soldier were you? <BR> Once.
6221,Hello. <BR> Hey. It's me. <BR> Where are you? <BR> We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late. <BR> How late? <BR> No. Just like an hour or so. <BR> What about the chairs? <BR> Okay. <BR> What okay? <BR> What! <BR> The chairs. <BR> I left a message. I think it's going to be okay. <BR> You sound funny. Did you do cocaine? <BR> No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
6222,Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke! <BR> Yippy!
6223,Well girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections. <BR> Yes! <BR> You're clean. <BR> Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night. <BR> Now you gotta be careful.
6224,When you get to Ostia use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia. <BR> No!
6225,And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river. <BR> The Little Walking River. You're right. This is part of it. So whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought. Goddamn.
6226,While Sam and I take out the back two cars... <BR> Leaving...
6227,You still should've moved. <BR> I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
6228,"Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening. <BR> Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle. <BR> Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean. <BR> Fifth and Mayflower. You know it? <BR> Yes. One of my friends was there. I wonder if you ever clipped her."
6229,Call me. <BR> Tonight. Let's get together. <BR> Okay.
6230,It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been? <BR> I had a fight up at Sportsman's. <BR> Well you look it. You win? <BR> Draw. <BR> What's your record at? <BR> 5-5-1. <BR> Yeah well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money. <BR> Yeah sure. <BR> I'm serious. Humping sheetrock and driving on weekends got to get to you after a while. Might be nice to buy your lady something. All it takes is one fight.
6231,I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad. <BR> The question is does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly he hates you. <BR> What do you mean?
6232,What is that Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck? <BR> Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Well we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed. <BR> When was this like '96? <BR> '93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll. <BR> Nuh-uh 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there so you can't understand the magic. <BR> You weren't even alive!
6233,... I'll buy you some new ones. <BR> You don't have any fucking money..
6234,Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it? <BR> Do you know? <BR> No.
6235,Do you want to fuck now? <BR> Maybe another drink first. More tequila? <BR> OK... whatever.
6236,...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This... <BR> ...this is Conklin's computer. <BR> ...At the time of his death Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars. <BR> Do you know what his budget was? <BR> Excuse me. <BR> We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark. <BR> May I finish? <BR> Conklin might've been a nut but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive? <BR> What's definitive is that I just lost two people in Berlin! <BR> So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
6237,"Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention! <BR> That's a nice name for what you need... <BR> Come on, I have to get this dressing off... it itches! And what about my fish? Who is taking care of them?"
6238,--and we got a guy in Justice-- <BR> --Deep Throat?--
6239,She isn't that old. <BR> What do you mean? <BR> I mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty.
6240,Well let's get down to it honey-- how was he? <BR> Well he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place
6241,Look you weren't there.  It was weird.  She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident she knew.  Never mind. <BR> I thought we were finished with this bullshit.  This is police work not the psychic Hot Line.
6242,He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife. <BR> Walk walk walk. What'd you say? <BR> He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife. <BR> Yeah what'd you tell him? <BR> I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and uh Tony Gorilla said if you did anything you're fucked up. <BR> You think he's goin' home makin' a beef behind my back? <BR> Nah. You would've heard somethin'. <BR> Yeah what's to stop him? <BR> I know. I know. <BR> I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything you know? <BR> Yeah but they keep askin' about it. <BR> Well now sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet you know. But I w- You know but you know what I want you to do? <BR> What?
6243,Why isn't he dead?  Damn you you promised me he would be dead! <BR> Caesar I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control...
6244,I suppose you thought the Presidency was above this sort of thing. <BR> Sir? <BR>  <BR> I'll talk to Helms.  Oh Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight. <BR> No no not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do. <BR> Yes sir.  I'll talk to Helms and uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing?  What do I tell Ziegler to tell them?
6245,I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere it's unusual but -- <BR> Not just a baby Porthos.  I carried the child of the king. <BR> The child of the king is... the king.  Louis! <BR> No not Louis! <BR> Athos do you understand this?  He confuses me -- <BR> I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night and one of them was sent away in secret! <BR> But why? <BR> Because the old king had a twin as well and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.  Then he had two heirs not just sons but twins.  So he decided that one be put away as if he never existed.  You Phillippe.
6246,I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play... <BR> Clyde Fitch thought you may not think so was well before my time! <BR> I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot... <BR> I don't think that's funny! <BR> Of course it's funny - this is all too laughable to be anything else. You know what I think about this - this age obsession of yours - and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because I spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid- <BR> Twenty minutes! <BR> Thirty minutes forty minutes! What of it? <BR> Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk talk think eat sleep! <BR> Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible! <BR> Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges! <BR> For instance what? <BR> For instance - you! <BR> This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but I'm not going to. I'm too mad- <BR> - guilty. <BR> Mad! Darling there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve... <BR> What about her teeth? What about her fangs? <BR> She hasn't cut them yet and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word look thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of! <BR> Cut! Print it! What happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?
6247,You know where it is? <BR> Um yeah thirty miles east.
6248,Not have it. <BR> No. There's no way. I mean don't you think there's no way? <BR> Well no I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance. <BR> 
6249,I'm in love with Libbets Casey. <BR> Yeah well you've been in love with like every other girl here I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets. <BR> It's beyond mere physical attraction. <BR> That's good because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act. <BR> Truly? Do speak. <BR> My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her! <BR> How do you know this shit? <BR> They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad? <BR> You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here? <BR> Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him? <BR> Good thinking Marge.
6250,What's the matter here? <BR> I begged him to let me put that on! <BR> He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
6251,Are you finished? <BR> No.  This is my lawyer Samuel Sutherland.  I thought you two should meet. <BR> We met this morning.  I signed the termination contract for Baer/Grace. I accepted your settlement Nicholas. you were right.  I'm going sailing.
6252,Hi it's Joel. <BR> Hey lover. Whatcha doing? <BR> I'm just y'know passing the time best I can till I can see you. <BR> God I can't believe I ever hated you. <BR> You must have been crazy. <BR> Guess what I'm wearing. <BR> I don't know. Panties and -- <BR> Your dried cum. <BR> Jesus.
6253,Grusinskaya -- <BR> Yes. <BR> You do believe that I really love you? <BR> Yes -- If I didn't believe that I'd die after last night. <BR> I want to be good to you -- madly good. <BR> Suzette will be back here in a minute. <BR> I'll go -- good-bye. <BR> Shall I see you again? <BR> I --
6254,"I'm, uh, going to bed. <BR> So early? <BR> Rough day. Good night."
6255,Where's the boy? <BR> Upstairs. He's quite docile. <BR> I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age. <BR> Respectfully sir... there'll never be another one like you.
6256,All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan. <BR> I'm calling the police. <BR> So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them.  Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat - It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that?
6257,I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all every one! <BR> It shall be done your Majesty. <BR> Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain! <BR> Yes your Majesty.
6258,I know the owner of Campton Place.  I could talk to him in the morning. <BR> Don't.  It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
6259,Emily? <BR> Your wife. <BR> Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown. <BR> Perfect. Well then shall we?
6260,What the fuck is he doing? <BR> Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message. <BR> It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated. <BR> All of them?
6261,You're late Cartman! <BR> I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me. <BR> Your behind? <BR> I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-  OW!!! <BR> Did you bring the pie and punch? <BR> No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead.
6262,My God. How I'd love to see that. <BR> They have safaris for tourists now. Maybe you can convince your husband.
6263,What brings you out here... <BR> Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad you always gotta light up when you see me it's the... <BR> Don't start alright. <BR> Alright. Why so pissed? <BR> Goddamn fare wars are murdering us. Had to lay off five guys. Nothing I could do. What is it... money?
6264,Nice... <BR> It's something Users do. <BR> Where's Flynn?
6265, <BR> Not random at all maybe. Like there's some pattern here...? <BR> But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order. <BR> Well except for the one girl. <BR> What girl? <BR> The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.
6266,A fighter huh? <BR> He was born fighting. And born hungry. <BR> Drink drink Juanito. You'll never have it so good. <BR> He'll have it good. Some day.
6267,"You said you weren't coming? <BR> I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen. <BR> What did you find? <BR> Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body. <BR> How was it contracted? <BR> That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat."
6268,Yeah. <BR> He was a moocher a card cheat a country-club golf hustler. A scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks.
6269,You should watch that! <BR> In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you. <BR> Hardly. <BR> Have you done something to your hair?
6270,--look when the Watergate grand jury questioned you did you name names? <BR> Of course--everything they asked--
6271,Diss digg diss digg diss digg. <BR> I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
6272,Let's not be too hasty. <BR> Yeah. Hell what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now gonna be Coastguard FBI who knows who all over the place.
6273,Go on. Get in your tent. You don't know nothin'. <BR> How 'bout you? <BR> *Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody you know.  An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around. <BR> But ain't no reason-- <BR> Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you but if you mess in this your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary. <BR> Okay. I think you're a darn fool though. <BR> Sure. Why not?
6274,What a day - what a heavenly day... <BR> D-day. <BR> Just like it. <BR> And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality... <BR> Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken want to run away or something. Instead I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go... <BR> Are you that sure of tomorrow? <BR> Aren't you? <BR> Frankly - yes.
6275,What's with the wigs? <BR> I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents. <BR> You think those are good presents? Who wants an old wig?
6276,"ON BREAN AND MOSS, WHO WALK SCHUMANN ACROSS THE HIGHWAY. IN THE B.G. WE SEE AMES TALKING TO THE DRIVER OF THE HARVESTER, WHO IS A SMALL, HISPANIC MAN. <BR> "
6277,Hey Gallagher! <BR> Yeah? <BR> How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach? <BR> It'll be ready in a minute. <BR> Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job. <BR> Sorry boss <BR> Don't be sorry. Just get the breakfast that's all.
6278,Ginger called me. <BR> Yeah. <BR> I just told you. She called me. <BR> And what'd she want? <BR> She was afraid to call you. <BR> Yeah she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy.
6279,Commodus it's we who are going on the offensive. <BR> The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable. <BR> Commodus -- listen to Narcissus listen to the man who has never lost a battle for Rome!  You're young with years ahead of you before you gain the experience to wear the purple!
6280,A drink Baron -- A Louisiana flip? <BR> No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
6281,What did you say? What did you do? <BR> Nothing! Swear to God I didn't do nothing! <BR> Look you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!
6282,Okay then. I'll catch you later Randall ... <BR> Double-meaning intended right? <BR> Right ...

6284,I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH?  She was here.. <BR> We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something? <BR> You're in violation. <BR> Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.
6285,I wouldn't - <BR> Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.
6286,I'll say a prayer for you in Church today Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off. <BR> You sure you know where to find one? <BR> I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men Starks. <BR> And what does that mean? <BR> Means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to.
6287,Yo. <BR> Damone. It's Mark. <BR> Mark. What happened to your date? <BR> It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home. <BR> Did you go home and get it? <BR> No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything.

The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way. <BR> I can't help that. All I know is I got my orders.

That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time. <BR> I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head? <BR> Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me Sammy you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way. <BR> Listen Nick you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over I'm gonna tell you it's all over if I don't get that license.  And believe me if it goes bad for me it's gonna go bad for a lot of people you understand? <BR> Yeah forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know I don't know what it is Sammy but the more I talk to you the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me is that it? <BR> No I don't wanna come - <BR> You should say so. <BR> I don't wanna come along with you. <BR> Just say so. <BR> I'll be honest with you. <BR> All right fine. <BR> I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about... <BR> Fine.
6303,I don't know. <BR> Let's just take it easy here alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody. <BR> Supposing he wants to get bad with us?
6304,Hey now wait a sec... <BR>  <BR> I think you'd better leave now. <BR> You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?! <BR> You're loitering in here and causing a disturbance. <BR> You're the disturbance pal! And here...  I'm buying some... what's this?...

6307,Your birthday celebration your Majesty? <BR> Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits. <BR> Well... perhaps you should speak with them your Majesty. <BR> I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits whoever he is is angling to become Pope himself. <BR> How can I serve you in this? <BR> Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest but you were once a Musketeer serving the throne of France a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission and keep it private? <BR> If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me. <BR> Once a Musketeer always a Musketeer eh?
6308,So I've got to drop the van off. <BR> Thanks Stan. Thanks.
6309,I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away after all. <BR> Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you. <BR> Yeah? <BR> I'd like to... take you out or something. <BR> Well you're married. <BR> Not yet. Not married. <BR> Look man I'm telling you right off the bat I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me you're with me. <BR> Okay. <BR> So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
6310,Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show take her down to the boat. <BR> You sure this is okay? <BR> Curly you know how long I been in business.
6311,You remember what happened next? <BR> I came over to the bed and you smelled so good like you just woke up slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like -- <BR> -- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?
6312,You shouldn't have hit me. <BR> You want to get into this now? <BR> No no Caesar.  Not now.
6313,Hey relax Satan. Don't get all worked up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer again. <BR> Mrph mprph!! <BR> What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy hell is for children. <BR> Mrph mprhm mm rmph! <BR> A deal? You wanna make a deal with the devil. Well sure deals are mounds o' fun.
6314,Look Harp.  Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  Let me ride him in. <BR> Yeah sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--
6315,Speaking of which can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart. <BR> I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job.
6316,Behold good sir! The very first photo of your future child. <BR> You're kidding!
6317,She seems pleasant enough. <BR> She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs. <BR> That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy does.
6318,Yeah.  Drag huh? <BR> I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
6319,Then this is our chance. <BR> Our chance to do what? <BR> I don't know these guys but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.  They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em sink our boats and then call us crazy.
6320,Okay Jason your move. <BR> Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
6321,Hi Mary Lou - Rosella - Okay Dolores get a move on - How's your back Olga? <BR> Clarinet - drums - trumpet - trombone -
6322,Mary had been there one night and had left. <BR> With the forty thousand dollars? <BR> He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about! <BR> Like what? <BR> Go out there! Find somebody ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what! <BR> I think something's wrong too Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong.  I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates...  and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money. <BR> He said he was dissatisfied... and was going back.
6323,He's upset about Adam. We're all upset. <BR> I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers. <BR> Lois please.
6324,So I just come by to see how you're doin'? <BR> You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'? <BR> Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay? <BR> Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want Frankie? <BR> I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day. <BR> A little? <BR> Yeah. I mean you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So I've decided to make it up to you. <BR> You gonna forget about the money I owe you? <BR> What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I was thinking I'd throw a little extra work your way. You know you come down to the club make espresso for the boys... wash their cars... run some errands... things like that.
6325,Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement! <BR> You're sure?! <BR> Relatively.
6326,Walter's on campus being the good soldier for WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing too. <BR> I heard. <BR> You heard? How? <BR> A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning. <BR> Did you confess?
6327,Can I have your autograph? <BR> You don't want my autograph. <BR> Yeah I do. It's for my girl friend. Make it out to Ralph. <BR> Your girl friend's name is Ralph? <BR> It's for my brudder.  Alvy Singer! Hey! This is Alvy-
6328,Well I'm a working girl Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own. <BR> When did you come in? <BR> I was the one who pretended to be Mrs. Mulwray remember?
6329,What can that gun of yours do? <BR> Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.
6330,WHAT A JOKE... <BR> WHAT A JOKE... <BR> YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE... <BR> YOU PLAY FOR BROKE... <BR> HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING... <BR> OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME... <BR> YOU KEEP GOING BACK IT'S DRIVING YOU INSANE
6331,Maybe it's all for the better you know? Yesterday at dinner well she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you I mean have you noticed anything? <BR> Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her. <BR> Yeah but I -- I've been working a lot lately and -- No that's not it. I guess we've just been on the verge of saying something whatever it is just saying something to each other. On the verge.
6332,Take the picture out. <BR> What's wrong? <BR> Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me. <BR> I don't...
6333,You going to sit here all day? <BR> I don't know. I haven't decided yet. <BR> Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning. <BR> It's a free country isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come. <BR> Let me give you some useful information son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it that's a losing proposition. <BR> I'm not going to rob you mister.  Do I look like a thief? <BR> I don't know what you look like boy. As far as I can tell you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there? <BR> Just passing through. <BR> Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam kid that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself. <BR> I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown it's kind of interesting. <BR> It's rundown all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did Rembrandt. <BR> It'll cost you five bucks. <BR> Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it? <BR> Once you look at it you're going to want to buy it from me. That's guaranteed. And that's the price: five bucks. So if you're not willing to spring for it you might as well not bother to look. It'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable. <BR> Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work aren't you? <BR> I just tell it like it is mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves though you might want to think about hiring me. <BR> Do you have eyes in your head or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas? <BR> Not a one. <BR> Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago and if business don't pick up soon I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages. <BR> It was just a thought. <BR> Yeah well do your thinking somewhere else Michelangelo. I got work to do.
6334,Uh we're just starting our program... <BR> This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
6335,As I suspected you're a rank sentimentalist. <BR> Yeah? Why? <BR> Why do you interfere with my little romances? <BR> Put it down as a gesture to love. <BR> Well I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde and it will make me very happy if she loses. Uh huh!
6336,Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough Ruby. But no bawling okay? I can't stand people who blubber. <BR> I'm sorry baby. I can't help it.
6337,Hello. <BR> Have you got your checkbook handy Mr. Cross? I've got the girl. <BR> You've got her? Where? <BR> Do you remember the figures we discussed? <BR> Of course I do. Where are you? <BR> At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here? <BR> Two hours... tell me will Evelyn be there as well? <BR> Either that or she'll be in jail. <BR> What are you talking about? <BR> Just bring your checkbook.
6338,Let's wait it out. <BR> They'll tear this place down within the hour.
6339,Caesar is going to get the money and bring -- <BR> How much money? <BR> Shelly said it was over two million dollars.
6340,One idea that if you had fucking listened to you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars. <BR> You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries. <BR> I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house. Took care of that one didn't I?  Prison Communications.
6341,You're out of line Starling and you're off this case. Back to Quantico. <BR> Sir Mr. Crawford instructed me - <BR> Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director and the Director answers to me. My God Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it. <BR> I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico. <BR> Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon as you get back. The gun too. Be on the next plane Starling there's one in 90 minutes.
6342,Sara my arm. I'm stuck honey. <BR> I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
6343,Okay let me have this. <BR> Well what are you doing... what are you doing with- <BR> Honey there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick.
6344,I mean most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing? <BR> I can't work this. <BR> We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge. <BR> But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this anyway? <BR> Because you clash Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly you look like something out of... Pasadena. <BR> My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable. <BR> Well you're on my turf now.  You're just gonna have to trust me.
6345,I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.  The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.  She wanted to move to Boston.  How badly did she hurt us Joe? <BR> I don't know.
6346,Where did you girls play before? <BR> Oh - here and there - and around.
6347,Hey it is my pleasure. <BR> Yeah I heard a lot about you. <BR> Oh thank you sir.
6348,How clear is Manchester? <BR> Foggy -- frightfully foggy always I'm told.  Have you said anything about Manchester Mr. Preysing?
6349,I came here to see that you stay alive.  The people need a living breathing alternative to Commodus a hero. <BR> You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist. <BR> But you do exist.  Narcissus:  hero of the battle of the Danube.
6350,What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there? <BR> We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list. <BR> How about Kissinger along with him? <BR> Kissinger's misunderstood.  He pretends to be a liberal for his Establishment friends but he's even tougher than I am ...
6351,I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer I'm going to cut off one finger. <BR> No. <BR> When I reach ten then I'll start with you.
6352,"Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it? <BR> Hmm. Good night."
6353,Hey.  I'll take this stuff. <BR> You going to tell dad? <BR> Would it matter?  And what's that? <BR> You know it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico. <BR> It's not packed with explosives is it? <BR> No! <BR> Play with the whip.
6354,The hell are they?! <BR> They took a left at the next light! <BR> You sure?!
6355,Major Dallas if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance. <BR> What mission? <BR> To save the world. <BR> Where have I heard this song before? <BR> You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'? <BR> Just one... why me? <BR> Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.
6356,Why were the other two women killed? <BR> Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
6357,Oh look look there's that... that's that's my old house. That's where we used to live. <BR> Holy cow!
6358,So what's the prognosis Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus? <BR> I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah there's that pink plus sign again. God it's unholy.
6359,So you're just going to give up and go home? <BR> I don't have much choice do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around. <BR> Still you can't just write her off. <BR> Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore and if she wants to throw away her life that's her business. <BR> She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up. <BR> Dream on Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday. <BR> Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs. <BR> I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke. <BR> No you're not. <BR> Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car. <BR> Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well my tugboat came in. I'm flush. <BR> Bully for you. <BR> No bully for you.
6360,Alright it's done. <BR> You see the bullet? <BR> Clearly. <BR> Good.  Now take the forceps and remember Vincent what we're doing here is routine.  I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  There are no vital organs where you're working no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.
6361,Fantastic! What talent. <BR> You still got the touch Junior.
6362,Walter we'll pick up here next time. <BR> I want to talk about it now. <BR> We'll talk about it more on Thursday. <BR>  <BR> Go home Walter. <BR> Now I know. It's when I can see a girl be near a girl even talk to a girl... and walk away.  That's my idea of being normal.
6363,Jesus. Oil? <BR> Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry. <BR> 1868... <BR> What? <BR> That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium. <BR> We're standin' on broken treaty ground Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water. <BR> Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy get the Warriors involved. <BR> So they took care of Leo. <BR> Listen to the water... the river keeps goin' down then rising again.
6364,What are you doing in New York...? <BR> Come on we'll get a cup of coffee...
6365,Who are you? <BR> Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian? <BR> Yes. Friedmans the fuckin Austrian! <BR> Where is he? <BR> I dont know. Hes gone!  Hes gone. I dont fucking know where I swear... Hes gone. On holiday... <BR> ...On holiday? <BR> Yeah... This morning. He left this fucking bloody morning... Jesus man my knees...
6366,We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official yeah? <BR> No. No that's Ray here. Ray uh...  Ray... Little Weasel.
6367,How about in the forum.  Right in front of the Senate. <BR> If I may be so bold... <BR> For the gods spit it out! <BR> Why not do it in the Colosseum?
6368,And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand? <BR> You're out of bullets.
6369,Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi there was a diver.  At my house the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks... <BR> That's not true... <BR> It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration... <BR> No... <BR> Open that door you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party... <BR> Stop it! <BR> Please Nicholas let me show you...
6370,The Uzi 9 millimeter. <BR> You know your weapons buddy.
6371,Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along. <BR> I haven't read that. <BR> I haven't either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*. <BR> But isn't Fuzzy just... well underdeveloped? <BR> 
6372,We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over. <BR> I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands? <BR> No. <BR> Can't do it with both hands? <BR> No Sir. <BR> Can you do it with your left hand? <BR> Well I... I never tried. <BR> So you're a righty? <BR> Ye-yeah.
6373,So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you. <BR> Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you? <BR> You know full well there is and I go to meet it now. Come witness my revenge.
6374,You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us. <BR> Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married. <BR> I want to be a mommy so badly!
6375,We'll meet in three hours? <BR> I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
6376,- - like birds - - <BR> - - like birds.  What happen is they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - - <BR> - - a gizzard - - <BR> - - which is called a gizzard and it helps them mash their food but what happens after a while - - <BR> - - what happens is that after a while the stones get smooth every six weeks so the animal regurgitates them - - <BR> - - barfs them up - - <BR> - - and swallows fresh ones. <BR> And when she swallows the stones she swallows the poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.  Good work Tim.
6377,You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour. <BR> Where are you going? <BR> I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow. <BR> What if it's not who you think it is? <BR> If he crosses the bridge it is. <BR> There must be another way! <BR> I warned them Marie. I told them to leave us alone. <BR> Jason please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this. <BR> There's no choice.
6378,Many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body. Where has it been laid out? <BR> It hasn't been laid out we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up. <BR> Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow? <BR> You know nothing about feelings natural or unnatural. <BR> Then without feeling your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say happier side? <BR> If my guests do not like it here I suggest they accompany you to the nursery where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.
6379,Do I have to talk to those two? <BR> My boss and your boss.  Sure.
6380,I can barely do this in broad daylight. <BR> Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
6381,Will that be cash or charge? <BR> Better make it charge.  <BR> I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer aren't you? <BR> I confess. <BR> I keep waiting for the next novel to come out. Anything in the works?
6382,Gee Gallagher do you look good! What are you doing to yourself? <BR> Nothing. <BR> What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress? <BR> I dyed one and washed the other. <BR> Oh you dyed one and washed the other. Well! You certainly look good.
6383,I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable. <BR> M'hm. <BR> Those are the two categories... <BR> M'hm. <BR> ...you know they're- The-the horrible would be like uh I don't know terminal cases you know? <BR> M'hm. <BR> And blind people crippled... <BR> Yeah. <BR> I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me. <BR> M'hm. <BR> You know and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable. <BR> U-huh.
6384,Our group is full. <BR> Oh God was this like an RSVP thing?
6385,Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up? <BR> Forget those two clowns Heather.  Answer me did you get another call from that guy or not?
6386,What are you doing? <BR> Pretend we're just another couple.
6387,Do you have it? <BR> Not so fast.  Who's that? <BR> He's company. <BR> Bad company... <BR> What do you mean? <BR> He's a cop Vincent he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
6388,Joe I don't know what you think you know but you're wrong. <BR> Like hell I am. <BR> Joe trust me on this you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man and he wouldn't do that. <BR> You don't know jack shit. I do. This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.
6389,What had you to do with this Mother? <BR> He is your brother! <BR> He is nothing now.
6390,Yeah. <BR> Meet me at three. <BR> What - what Caesar's? <BR> No a... <BR> ...hundred yards further down the road. <BR> Why? <BR> Don't ask questions. Just be there.
6391,What're you going to do today? <BR> Turn in the car.  Clean my desk explain things to our sons then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss. <BR> I'll give notice. <BR> Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
6392,No. <BR> Why not? <BR> Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married. <BR> Jesus you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin Caitlin Caitlin... <BR> Veronica!
6393,Are you a Fremen? <BR> I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change. <BR> He's hiding something.
6394,The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us they'll go into a coma and die. <BR> How would we cut off the lysine? <BR> No trick to it.  Just stop running the program.  Leaving them unattended.
6395,Where's the tunnel? <BR> In the corner behind the curtain.
6396,Did Dickie's Dad go? <BR> He's having an early night. <BR> Poor man.  We were knocking on that door for ever.  I think I've broken my strap.
6397,Evening. Table for one? <BR> No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here please? <BR> Leon? No. Im afraid he left. <BR> Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his... <BR> No. I meant he left as in no longer works here. <BR> Oh. This is... Wed arranged to meet tonight and Im due to return to Paris tomorrow... <BR> Im sorry... <BR> Yes. You wouldnt know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
6398,If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight? <BR> Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand. <BR> Oh of course.  which of these instruments do you play? <BR> Bull fiddle. <BR> Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it? <BR> Most of the time I slap it. <BR> You must be quite a girl. <BR> Wanna bet? <BR> My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up. <BR> Why? <BR> She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.
6399,Agent Little Weasel Federal Bura of your Imagination. <BR> Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing? <BR> You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed and we don't listen. Well he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar and this Hoss is gettin' watered. <BR> Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here Man. <BR> Cuz I'm a skin? <BR> Cuz you're a cop. <BR> Not no more. <BR> What are you talking about? <BR> You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case man. I don't give a goddamn about your case. <BR> And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not Crow Horse but I didn't cut you.
6400,Uh... have you been *feeling* okay? <BR> When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh goodness. You meant... yes I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
6401,Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package instead of sitting here with us. <BR> Exactly.  Gregor he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor he was their insurance and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...
6402,Attractive... <BR> Don't ask. <BR> I checked it personally.
6403, <BR> Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for. <BR> He is an abomination!
6404,You can put it anywhere. <BR> Even there? <BR> It would feel so yummy.
6405,Daniel... <BR> What?  No kiss?  Not even for old times sake?
6406,...Geez. <BR> Yah. Say Lou ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685? <BR> Yah that's a good one. <BR> Yah.
6407,He's my father. <BR> Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
6408,I'll fix ya some eggs. <BR> That's okay hon. I gotta run. <BR> Gotta eat a breakfast Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs. <BR> Aw you can sleep hon. <BR> Ya gotta eat a breakfast...
6409,I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. if you need to. come to where I live. O.K.? <BR> Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me huh? <BR> Yes. <BR> . or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now. <BR> No. I should go. <BR> Please. please stay.
6410,We had to have financing. <BR> Tuitions expensive.
6411,Who's on television? <BR> This guy on the Johnny Carson show.
6412,Um... Juno can I -- Can I touch it? <BR> Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.
6413,May I help you madam ... <BR> Mr. John Steed please. <BR> I'm afraid that's impossible. <BR> Impossible?
6414,What'd you find up there? <BR> Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since. <BR> She was sailing up north right? <BR> Her destination was Halifax yeah. <BR> Well suppose she got a little further north than she should have.  Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack which moved further north where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her.
6415,Where you going? <BR> Out. <BR> It's freezing. <BR> Yeah. When it freezes I guess that means the molecules are not moving. So when you breathe there's nothing in the air you know to breathe in to your body. The molecules have stopped. So it's clean.
6416,...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand? <BR> I'll take care of it Remo. <BR> E mo va! [Italian-American slang for 'Now go!']
6417,They are not my clients. <BR> You're a lawyer and you're here-- <BR> --I met one of the defendants Mr. Barker at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say. <BR> A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami. <BR> Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then. <BR> It was really nice of you to come since you'd only met him once. <BR> Are you implying you don't believe me? <BR> I have nothing more to say. <BR> You don't mind getting on people's nerves do you?
6418,This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most. <BR> I'm getting really tired of your bullshit. <BR> My what? <BR> You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly. <BR> You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation? <BR> I'm talking about some bad bad very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things! <BR> Okay fine. <BR> Fine? Fine what? <BR> Whatever you say Kojak. <BR> I'm serious. <BR> I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money.
6419,Is this what you killed them with? <BR> You've been listening to rumors. <BR> Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder. <BR> You are.  Now.
6420,What's the plan. <BR> First of all we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment. <BR> Brilliant. <BR> Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there. <BR> This is not my usual Friday night!
6421,You saved my life Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you. <BR> Move it. We got exactly five minutes left. <BR> It's just...now that I'm leaving I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone? <BR> Oh don't you worry. I'll be fine. <BR> You've been a hell of a figment pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me.
6422,"Fight fair, son...Use your fists! <BR> Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone..."
6423,Well? <BR> I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down. <BR> You haven't tried locking them up! <BR> You want 'em all arrested? <BR> No just the ring leaders. The fire-eaters. And the ones with big families ...  Barton -- where's that boy?
6424,I've got to work... <BR> Do you want me to go...? <BR> No no I'm just...
6425,I can't do that. But if you wait a minute... <BR> Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please Brad? <BR> I'm sorry sir. Just let me find the forms here. <BR> I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...
6426,Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public. <BR> Yeah. <BR> Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it huh?
6427,So really it's good luck. <BR> Good luck? <BR> Yeah good luck. I mean what the fuck. The guy had no legs.
6428,This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out. <BR> Is he all right?
6429,The case..with the stones... Where is it? <BR> San Agamat chay bet... envolet! <BR> The case was stolen?
6430,Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.  Get the fuck out of here. <BR> Thanks Nick. <BR> Yeah thanks.
6431,What's wrong? <BR> I think I came. Didn't you feel it? <BR> I guess I did.
6432,What the hell... <BR> I'm dreaming this.  Shit this is a dream. <BR> I'm not dreaming.
6433,Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream.  A treasure. <BR> Greater than treasure Usul.  We have thousands of such caches.  Only a few of us know them all.  When we have enough... we shall change the face of Arrakis. Listen!...
6434,Joely... <BR> Yeah Tangerine? <BR> Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit? <BR> No. <BR> 
6435,Who do they think I am?! <BR> Jeanne calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks. <BR> There's nothing to hear -- I haven't done anything.  And why haven't I done anything?  Because none of you will listen to me!!
6436, <BR> Early. Still dark. <BR> Then something woke you. What? Did you dream...? What was it?
6437,"I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder? <BR> How? <BR> I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper. <BR> You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why? <BR> According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder? <BR> It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago. <BR> And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas? <BR> Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?"
6438,Did they kill him? <BR> No.  He cut an ear from one of the men no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son at the front.
6439,No. <BR> Ancient Greece.  Alchimadus was imprisoned by his king.
6440,"I saw the flag signal--what's up? <BR> Nothing that's the problem--the story's gone underground. <BR> You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get try to keep you on the right track but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much? <BR> I don't know maybe sixteen eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice the FBI but it's still drying up. <BR> Then there must be something mustn't there. Look forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is these are not very bright guys and things got out of hand. <BR> If you don't like them why won't you be more concrete with me? <BR> Because the press stinks too--history on the run that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything? <BR> John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag. <BR> Follow the money. Always follow the money. <BR> To where? <BR> Go on. <BR> This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot we just don't know what. <BR> You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you? <BR> I did everything you said but it all seemed-- <BR> --melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City. <BR> What's the whole thing about--do you know? <BR> What I know you'll have to find out on your own. <BR> Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk? <BR> Talk? Once, at a gathering, he put his hand over a candle. And he kept it there. He kept it right in the flame until his flesh seared. A woman who was watching asked, What's the trick?"""" And he replied. """"The trick is not minding."""""""
6441,Whoa whoa.  Come on he's making too much noise. <BR> You hear that bitch?  Be quiet! <BR> Here put this in his mouth.
6442,Well you take a meeting with him I'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with Freddy. <BR> I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him. <BR> All the good meetings are taken.
6443,Monsieur Blaine I wonder if I could talk to you? <BR> Go ahead. <BR> Well isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential what I have to say. <BR> My office. <BR> Right.
6444,And while visiting our fair city you...  An Austrian? <BR> An Austrian. <BR> An Austrian... Not much to go on is it? <BR> Questions can amount to revelations. Now Id hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
6445,Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure. <BR> I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens. <BR> I doubt that. <BR> Why? <BR> Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change. <BR> Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course being with Richard. <BR> What's he like?
6446,Are you O.K.? <BR> I'm fine. <BR> I heard you got attacked. <BR> I did. <BR> I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash? <BR> Yeah. I think it's really sick. <BR> Why? <BR> Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party. <BR> Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me. <BR> Did Sharon say no? <BR> You know I want to go with you. <BR> I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded. <BR> Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose. <BR> No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night my father was waiting up for me.
6447,Glenlivet right Gino? <BR> I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
6448,So you like bookstores huh? <BR> I like to read. <BR> Me too. It is Rain Dogs by the way. <BR> Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But -- <BR>  <BR> Sort of um... <BR>  <BR> What? <BR> 
6449,Is it possible Mrs. Clinton? <BR> Just... tell us what you want.
6450,Oh - in here. <BR> Of course.  On Thursdays they always serve me in the small salon.
6451,You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it! <BR> Clem I'm sorry. I shouldn't have -- <BR> I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!
6452,You sure you don't want me to stay on. <BR> No. No. Thank you. You go home.
6453,I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine. <BR> What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me Marcel?
6454,What do you think? <BR> About what? <BR> About this guy this Hugo person. <BR> I don't have time. <BR> I'm only asking what you think. <BR> I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
6455,Seating problems. <BR> Okay. <BR> Keith do not trivialize this. <BR> I'm not. What's the problem? <BR> We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded. <BR> What kind of seats can we have? <BR> Not padded ones. <BR> So what do we do? <BR> You go down there. <BR> Go down where? <BR> Go down to the seat place and straighten this out. <BR> Honey I don't have the time... <BR> I need your help. <BR> We're leaving in three hours. <BR> I need your help. <BR> I'll call them from the road. <BR> Do you love me? <BR> More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever. <BR> Take care of those chairs. <BR> We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off. <BR> Maybe.
6456,She took care of the dealers... <BR> Hey Mitch. <BR> ...pit bosses floor managers. <BR> Thank you. <BR> But mostly...
6457,So go. <BR>  <BR> What if you stay this time? <BR> I walked out the door. There's no more memory. <BR> Come back and make up a good-bye at least. Let's pretend we had one.
6458,Well well well. Huh? <BR> Yeah. <BR> It's a long road that has no turning. <BR> That's for sure Frank.
6459,Can't find the shotgun. <BR> So whoever did this now has our shotgun. <BR> Doesn't look like it much matters.
6460,Good Christ!  Can't you lose these jokers? <BR> They're good!
6461,Well I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go. <BR> Wait don't hang up. <BR> Okay? <BR> What are you doing? <BR> Reading.
6462,Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton Deputy Chief in the Department. <BR> J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter. <BR> I wonder if you'd care to wait in my office?
6463,No Johnnie.  No goddamned phones. Not now. <BR> Pop? <BR> Caesar come here.  Sit.  We talk now.  You too Johnnie.
6464,Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do I guess. <BR> What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
6465, <BR> So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother? <BR> Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito. If we got what we wanted we'd let his brother go providing he tells us where the Van Gogh and the other paintings are.
6466,"You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son? <BR> I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it. <BR> Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds. <BR> Dad, the ponds are for old ladies. <BR> Just a favor for your old man. <BR> Sure, Dad."
6467,What was that? <BR> Oh nothing. <BR> Tell me. <BR> No. It is too judgmental. <BR> Tell me what he said. <BR> He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
6468,"You were right. Del wasn't lying. <BR> Well, you were right about what that bartender said."
6469,Want to go up to your office Mr. Alexander? <BR> Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee? <BR> You're welcome to one. <BR> No thanks. <BR> The men would like to know who this gentleman is. <BR> That's none of their affair.
6470,Anything else from Mr. Throat? <BR> Mitchell started the cover-up early everyone is involved in the cover- up all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible.  And people's lives are in danger maybe including ours.
6471,What! What are you talking about? <BR> The body of Joan Gale! <BR> Hello Express. What's the idea trying to outsmart the police? <BR> I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement and I saw the most horrible thing down there. <BR> Are you giving me this straight? <BR> Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
6472,[Beat] Why'd you stop? <BR> Shit happens and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from? <BR> I don't know but I think part of it's...
6473,It's finally over. <BR> No.  There is another chip.
6474,Jeanne I beg of you... sign!  In God's name don't you understand? I'm trying to save you!  If you don't sign the English will burn you to death!  Is that what you want?? <BR> No... I want to be confessed.
6475,Lillian was here. In Lawford. <BR> Huh? <BR> The night before the shooting. <BR> How was she? <BR> Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home. <BR> Who? <BR> Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me. <BR> What happened? <BR> A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know 'cause of Jill.
6476,Your majesty I really think you... <BR> My dear loyal Tremoille I know I can count on you... <BR> ... as always majesty... <BR> ... to ensure our privacy.  I need to talk to her.  Alone.
6477,Do I know you from somewhere? <BR> You may have known my father William Starks.
6478,So you're goin' to the Gophers on Sunday? <BR> You bet. <BR> You wouldn't have an extra ticket there? <BR> They're playin' the Buckeyes! <BR> Yah. <BR> Ya kiddin'!
6479,Oh Jesus. <BR> He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not. <BR> Oh Jesus. Of course I can't.
6480,Oh and there's another thing about New York. See... you-you wanna see a movie you have to stand in a long line. <BR> Yeah. <BR> It could be freezing it could be raining. <BR> Yeah. <BR> And here you just-
6481,You just worry about yourself James. Okay? <BR> Okay.
6482,I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while -- <BR> -- We might as well be frank Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles.
6483,Two minutes Alvy. <BR> No I'm sorry I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know uh I-I can't go in in the middle. <BR> In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish. <BR> You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next- <BR> Two hours? No u-uh I'm going in. I'm going in.
6484,Get out of here Ray -- <BR> One more night -- <BR> Get out -- <BR> I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ...
6485,We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel. <BR> So you say ...
6486,I can explain it.  Attempted murder wasn't enough for him.  He wants to add kidnapping to the charges. <BR> If you'd like we can go straight to the authorities.  I understand they are very interested in talking to you.
6487,Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television. <BR> That's right Buzz and you know when I did it? Last match last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten the Fazeli Split. <BR> You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner. <BR> I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz. <BR> Look kid gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up. <BR> I couldn't care less.
6488,I'm leaving. <BR> Leaving what? <BR> England.  There is nothing for me here anymore. <BR> And what do you think you will find in another land? <BR> Maybe myself. <BR> Then it's worth the journey.
6489,Yeah? <BR> Did you send this? Is it a joke? <BR> I probably got the same thing as you. <BR> I mean I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this? <BR> Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape. <BR> That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
6490,It's Stanley. It's the Steamer. Fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night. <BR> What did it say? <BR> A thousand things. <BR> You're hurting my head.
6491,Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner? <BR> No keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
6492,You can't leave. <BR> The hell I can't! <BR> I need you ... <BR> Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out. <BR> Violet I won't let you leave.
6493,They're roomates. <BR> And Joel's pre-med. <BR> The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision. <BR> Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum. <BR> Hallie?
6494,Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you really? -- I do not even know your name. <BR> I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix. <BR> Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you? <BR> I'm a prodigal son the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows. <BR> Really? <BR> Really I haven't a bit of character. None at all. <BR> No? <BR> When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school it was a monastery I learned to pray and lie -- and --- <BR> And? <BR> And then in the war to kill and hide. That's all. <BR> And what do you do -- now? <BR> I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig devouring anything of life that pleases me I really belong in jail <BR> Oh! What a picture -- and what else? <BR> I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief.  <BR> That's a silly joke. <BR> Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night.  <BR> What is the matter?
6495,I'm getting married... <BR> I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
6496,It's Andy again. <BR> Still not here. <BR>  In this corner? <BR> Yeah..
6497,You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus. <BR> Me? The King of Coitus? <BR> The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality. <BR> Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually... <BR> Why look who's here.
6498,Thank you Marcel for that... extremely redundant explanation. <BR> C'mon Laurant America? <BR> The job is worth about two million euros. Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money Daniel. You leave tomorrow.
6499,Oh I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious. <BR> So it's obvious huh?
6500,Then why did you bring it up? <BR> I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
6501,Dip? <BR> Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home you know.
6502,Who is that guy? <BR> It's okay. Look Hallie I'll meet you outside. <BR> No girletta I don't leave your side. <BR> I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
6503,Over there! <BR> What do you see? <BR> At least you handle the boat all right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.
6504,Hey... you got a fine one right here! <BR> Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
6505,I thought I was supposed to stay in my room. <BR> Get on the other side of that.
6506,If I'm right this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim. <BR> Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
6507,So modest. <BR> So sensitive. <BR> Oh come on Tripp. Cut the kid some slack. <BR> It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just once I'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth. <BR> The truth. I know that's always been real important to you. Okay check this out...
6508,Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now. <BR> What's with you?
6509,These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it. <BR> You got about two seconds to get your paws off me Tarzan. <BR> Or what?
6510,"No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move. <BR> Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft."
6511,What do you do for the F.B.I. Goodspeed. <BR> I'm a field agent. <BR> Tell me what you really do.
6512,You're not going!  You have to stay with us! <BR> How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time... <BR> Narcissus! <BR> Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you. <BR> I don't want you to die!
6513,Goddamnit why do they do that? <BR> How do I find them?  Their offices are empty. <BR> They own the whole building.  They just move from floor to floor.
6514,Oh no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one? <BR> I'm all right. <BR> You've got to eat something. You're just nervous about going over to see if you're Diane Selwyn.
6515,Oh MiGod. <BR> Guess who <u>I</u> am. <BR> I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u> who... <BR> I know who you are Mr. Ames. <BR> I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose <u>employ</u>... <BR> Quite touching. <BR> And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that equally I admit to <u>nothing</u> and that I would like my lawyer present. <BR> 
6516,Damn barbaric is what it is. <BR> Could be meant as a warning.
6517,Something's not right... <BR> -- Mulder! Get in the car!
6518,Close. We're so hush-hush even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see there's coconut cake date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ... <BR> Hmmm ... <BR> Looks like rain Steed...
6519,I needed to know. <BR> You need to know a lot of shit Vincent.
6520,I'm in no mood for trouble! <BR> What? <BR>  <BR> Can I trade in my car and take another? <BR> You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman you will!  That yours? <BR> Yes it's... nothing wrong with it I'm just... <BR> Sick of the sight of it!  Well suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about... <BR> No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I just want to make a change and start...
6521,Yes Sire. <BR> It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the open desert remember to breathe in through your mouth out through the nose tubes.
6522,Where do you look? What side of the neck? <BR> Left side.
6523,I won't ask again. <BR> I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone. <BR> What do you mean? <BR> Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but... <BR> Treadstone? <BR> ...which one are you?...
6524,I want you gone Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ... <BR> Consider me gone Detective -- <BR> I'll catch you later Randall -- <BR> Double-meaning intended -- <BR> You betcha --
6525,I'm leaving. <BR> When?.....How? <BR> Right now. <BR> But you can't...you.
6526,Are we going in this? <BR> Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine. <BR> It's pretty old. <BR> It belongs to Pop. <BR> Pop? <BR> Grandpa. My father. It's his. <BR> Oh.
6527,This is Doyle's house. <BR> This is L. B. Jefferies a friend of Tom's. Who am I talking with?
6528,Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me. <BR> Showing you what? <BR> What happened. <BR> Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks. <BR> No. I think they are were just passengers. Innocent victims. <BR> Victims of what? <BR> Something bad happened here Murphy. <BR> That much I think we've already established. <BR> More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold.
6529,You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong? <BR> I remember. <BR> Do you remember what you said? <BR> Yes. I said this is too good to live...
6530,Get this Frank--we got two patients. Number one the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony then throws himself through a glass window heads to the bedroom where he's now passed out. <BR> Well he's the steakhead of the night then. <BR> I don't think the fire people can touch him out there. <BR> How's he doing? <BR> I haven't had a chance to see him yet. I'm going to take care of sleeping beauty.
6531,What do you want? <BR> I need to talk to Annette. <BR> She's not here. <BR> Do you know where she is? <BR> She's out. <BR> Do you know when she'll be back? <BR> Later. Listen we're entertaining some guests so - <BR> Annette! Annette! <BR> Young man I already told you she's not here. <BR> Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
6532,You going to work all day? <BR> I'm sorry baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...
6533,All right mister. I'll go. You just show your license to contrack an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go. <BR> You trying to tell me how to run my own business? <BR> 'F we're workin' for you it's our business too. An' how do we know--  --you ain't one a the guys that sent these things out? <BR> Listen Smart Guy. I'll run my business my own way. I got work. If you wanta take it okay. If not just sit here that's all.
6534,What? <BR> The War is Over.  Senator Nole just ended the War.
6535,Oh no Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ... <BR> I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her.
6536,Excalibur! Is it true? <BR> The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it quickly!
6537,Dickie was at the Opera last night. <BR> I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to -- <BR> He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home. <BR> Really? That's swell. No I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great!
6538,Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you bellying up to my heart again man f you can't help falling off the stool. But he puts his mouth to her ears ... <BR> Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness.
6539,So.  You're a soldier. Fighting for whom? <BR> With the One Thirty Second under Perry from '21 to '27-- <BR> The year 2027?
6540,I really should go. I really need to catch my ride. <BR> I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
6541,I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it so light 'em if you got 'em. <BR> I'm ahead of you...partner. <BR> Uh what do I call you?
6542,Holy shit man your mom's got good titties. <BR> Shut the fuck up.
6543,Life is changing you Mr. Kringelein. <BR> Yes thanks to the Baron. The best shops the very best. Look Doctor silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat see -- made in England that's silk too -- fifty marks... Look the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
6544,And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder. <BR> Take it easy Ruby... <BR> Did you find a scalpel? Did you find a murder weapon?
6545,I want to see Brad. <BR> I understand your concern but I feel it's time you started thinking of yourself.  Look at yourself.
6546,I saved you. <BR> Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
6547,Caesar let me sponsor your first wager in the arena. <BR> I wouldn't know who to bet on.
6548,And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves. <BR> Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay so you want to do it the hard way huh?
6549,You talk to Max today? <BR> I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him. <BR> Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying if -- <BR> The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too. <BR> Well that's not gonna happen. <BR> Fine. You want to help Ricky talk to Maxie yourself. <BR> I feel weird asking him. <BR> You shouldn't. He likes you. <BR> I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it. <BR> Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me. <BR> No coke tonight.  Right? <BR> Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
6550,Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back. <BR> We don't know that -- <BR> I know it.  What do you want Robert?
6551,I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter. <BR> Did she believe you? <BR> I have no idea. <BR> You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious. <BR> Well I don't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me.
6552,Ditto. <BR> Where are you hiding him? He's impossible isn't he?
6553,I've missed you man ... <BR> I know. I've missed you too
6554,It's kind of embarrassing but <BR> Go ahead. <BR> I had a dream about this place. <BR> Oh boy. <BR> You see what I mean... <BR> Okay so you had a dream about this place. Tell me. <BR> Well ... it's the second one I've had but they were both the same......they start out that I'm in here but it's not day or night. It's kinda half night but it looks just like this except for the light but I'm scared like I can't tell ya. Of all people you're standing right over there by that counter. You're in both dreams and you're scared. I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are and then I realize what it is - there's a man...in back of this place. He's the one ... he's the one that's doing it. I can see him through the wall. I can see his face and I hope I never see that face ever outside a dream.
6555,Algeria. <BR> And you don't speak French? <BR> Well you know not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really -- <BR> -- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
6556,Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it? <BR> I'm about to Mr. President.
6557,Offering it for debate. <BR> It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
6558,About a dozen. <BR> A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
6559,It was a wonderful day. <BR> You still haven't answered my question. <BR> You know how I feel Tom. I just want to think it over. <BR> The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents-- <BR> You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it. <BR> A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
6560,Shut the fuck up or I'll throw you back in the trunk you know. <BR> Geez. That's more'n I've heard you say all week.
6561,SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up both of you before I kill you! <BR> I'm the one who watched the show... I was... <BR> Did Chloe crack? <BR> Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges... <BR> Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine? <BR> She's a lesbian.
6562,I'll be okay. <BR> Listen I'm just as nervous as you are. <BR> Really? <BR> Really.
6563,What man? What is it? <BR> Yo let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while. <BR> I can't man. <BR> Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please. <BR> Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK? <BR> OK.
6564,They were slaughtering the spring lambs? <BR> Yes...! They were screaming. <BR> So you ran away... <BR> No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there confused. They wouldn't run... <BR> But you could. You did. <BR> I took one lamb. And I ran away as fast as I could...
6565,I gave you my dog tags. <BR> No you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow. <BR> How'd he die? <BR> I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around through her now blurred eyes like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink then laughs nervously as she looks up. <BR> I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now I do though. And I want you out. Now. <BR> It's December 25th 1993 today. <BR> No it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th 2004.
6566,Hi Dad. <BR> Hey big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been? <BR> Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone? <BR> Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class. <BR> Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs. <BR> No but you know Bren. She dreams big. <BR> Yeah she does. <BR> You look a little morose honey. What's eating you? <BR> I'm losing my faith in humanity. <BR> Think you can narrow it down for me. <BR> I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good. <BR> You mean like couples? <BR> Yeah like people in love. <BR> Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition 'cause... well that's kind of messed up. <BR> Dad no! <BR> Well it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy? <BR> Please stop now. <BR> Tore up from the floor up? <BR> Dad it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years. <BR> It's not easy that's for sure. Now I may not have the best track record in the world but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
6567,Yeah it's her job. <BR> Is she responsible for the punch? <BR> No. <BR> Good.  It's terrible.
6568,Humboldt County? <BR> Maybe... <BR> It's my father. He gets it from his doctor. <BR> Glaucoma? <BR> Colon cancer. <BR> Jesus James. Wow.
6569,Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation OK? Let's just review our options here. <BR> We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police. <BR> Call the police. Okay that's one option. <BR>  <BR> Yes sir there sure is an option here. There are always options.
6570,Could be a fishing boat. <BR> Too big. More like a freighter.
6571,What is it about my writing that's so rotten? <BR> Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
6572,They think we're carrying Cuban refugees.  Skipper they mean to board us. <BR> Not a chance.  Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
6573,...if Jack told the truth he could be free by the time he's my age. <BR> Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question. <BR> You don't believe me? <BR> About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately? <BR> I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in. <BR> Has anybody offered to buy it? <BR> As a mater of fact yes. LaRiviere.
6574,Your Majesty... <BR> What is it d'Artagnan?  Assassins falling from the sky now?
6575,Happy birthday. <BR> What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding? <BR> Yeah hey why don't yuh try it on? <BR> Uh yeah uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you yeah but it's- <BR> Try it... it'll add years to our sex life. <BR> Uh huh. Yeah. Forget it.
6576,The Penny Saver sucks. <BR> Yeah but it sucks for free.
6577,...Well that passed. <BR> Yah? <BR> Yah. Now I'm hungry again. <BR> You had breakfast yet Margie? <BR> Oh yah. Norm made some eggs. <BR> Yah? Well what now d'ya think? <BR> Let's go take a look at that trooper.
6578,You remind me of me when I was...I guess I was never like you. So cute. So questioning. <BR> I'm not a nai-ive little... <BR> Uh-huh.
6579,Take it back Freb -- <BR> Hey now Memphis... C'mon man -
6580,Here you are. Would anyone like coffee? <BR> That sounds great! <BR> Anyone else?. Alright Jeffrey just a minute.
6581,I got my partner in there! <BR> I cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more.
6582,What's the worst thing you ever did? <BR> The worst? <BR> Yeah.
6583,Hi!  Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show. <BR> Ah Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal. <BR> Surely.
6584,Jesus Christ Larry what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name is it? What's your real name you fucking scumbag? <BR> Don't have one Carl. I have a number man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country Carl. Shame on you.
6585,So it's gonna be okay isn't it? <BR> Promise? <BR> God... I wish you...
6586,Don't panic.  When security gets here we simply explain what happened... <BR> They'll love that. <BR> Yes... well...
6587,Oh I'm a sham!! <BR> Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet Buzz. <BR> Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!
6588,Every successor will owe his loyalty to us. Together we take out Maranzano and each family gets a piece of his operation. <BR> A mother-fuckin' peace conference.
6589,And that's a bad thing? <BR> I'm trying to better myself but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away. <BR> I'm sorry but I'm not here to be your savior. <BR> Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you. <BR> You don't even know me. <BR> Don't you believe in love at first sight? <BR> Yes but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual. <BR> Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning? <BR> I can't. I'm seeing a friend. <BR> Who? <BR> That's none of your business. <BR> How about tonight? <BR> I'm busy. <BR> Doing what? <BR> That's also none of your business. <BR> Tell me what to do Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind. <BR> You truly want to do something to make me happy? <BR> Yes. <BR> And you promise to abide by it? <BR> Without question. <BR> Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York. <BR> What? <BR> If that's a problem then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends.
6590,I'm fully amenable to that discussion. <BR> I mean we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious. <BR> Of course. <BR> My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day. <BR> And I fully support that. <BR> But the thing is if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around. <BR> I completely agree. <BR> That's why I think it's time for us to --
6591,General do you realize what happened out there today? <BR> I didn't get killed and everyone else did. <BR> That's one way to look at it.
6592,Lovely isn't it? <BR> They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York and it would still get fucked up.
6593,The first assassination attempt was in '60 just before the election. <BR> Before?!  Eisenhower approved that? <BR> He didn't veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass Howard Hunt. <BR> Jesus! <BR> And not just Hunt.  Frank Sturgis all those Cubans.  All of them in the Watergate.  They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba.  Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President.  That's what worries the shit out of me.  I don't know how much Hunt knows.  Or the Cubans. <BR> So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall? <BR> Because ... because Dick Helms knows too much ... If anyone in this country knows more than I do it's Hoover and Helms!  You don't fuck with Dick Helms!  Period.
6594,What do you think? <BR> A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus. <BR> That would be my guess. <BR> Your guess?
6595,"You all right, sergeant? <BR> Dunno...Seems so. <BR> Well, go get cleaned up and we'll proceed with the weddin'..."
6596,The deal's too good Frankie <BR> What are ya thinkin' Charlie?
6597,It's a miracle!!! <BR> What is? <BR> I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
6598,Wait Crash--don't go--all I want is a date.  I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'. <BR> I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy. <BR> I'm not interested yet.
6599,Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter? <BR> What do you mean dear? <BR> I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber maybe? Or a gangster? <BR> No dear of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night darling.
6600,Come on Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way. <BR> I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it! <BR> You ought to know why. Because <BR> Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because <BR> Because marrying that fool King Westley is <BR> You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him. <BR> Not so far as I'm concerned you're not.  Yes?
6601,If he does it again he's out for good. I don't care what it is Nick I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again. <BR> I'm sorry about this. Really. <BR> All right Ace? <BR> Okay. <BR> Thanks pal.
6602,He was a politician. <BR> Did you cry when he died? <BR> Yes. <BR> Why? <BR> I don't know.  He made me see the stars ... <BR> How did he do that?  All those kids ... Why do they hate me so much?
6603,You don't need me... <BR> Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail.
6604,Where'd ya get this funny ravioli? <BR> Ya ignorant Guinea it's kreplach.
6605,You sure you got ever'thing ready? <BR> Ain't gonna be no trouble. <BR> You ain't to hurt them fellas.
6606,Sara? Hi. It's Grady. <BR> Where are you Grady? An elevator? <BR> I'm in Kinship. Listen Sara there's some things we need to talk about... <BR> You're in Kinship? <BR> Yes. But that's not why I called... <BR> With Emily? <BR> What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just... <BR> Just what? Doing a little dusting?
6607,And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko and his lawyer Mr. Salt. <BR> A pleasure to meet you Mr. Fox.
6608,I think I better take you home. <BR> What about those other guys you live with? <BR> No. I mean back to your home.
6609,Sorry sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long? <BR> Not at all. Morning Tom. <BR> Hi.  Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've seen a ghost...
6610,Hello there children!! <BR> Hey Chef. <BR> How would like some Salisbury Steak with buttered noodles?
6611,I think...I may have the answer. <BR> What? <BR> I remember...it was a long time ago...my father said: when the House was finally completed make sure...we-christen-it- with-this-bottle-of-dirt-cheap-champagne- that-should-still-be-in a cupboard somewhere!
6612,Berlin! <BR> I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family. <BR> You don't know what you're getting into here. <BR> And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
6613,It's as though there were two people in that room... both of them asleep... both of them dreaming. <BR> That doesn't make sense. <BR> Add it to the list. <BR> So what do we do?
6614,No comment. <BR> Don't you see how silly you're being? <BR> Okay Lisa -- probably you're right. He's probably in the bedroom now entertaining his wife with the indian rope trick. I'll admit to criminal insanity. Now when do I start the cure?
6615,I'm going to take Marge for a little walk Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you. <BR> We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to -- <BR> No he should talk to you alone.
6616,Wait before you do that help me to the kitchen I need to lay down. There's a cot back there. <BR> But -- <BR> It's much safer in there sweety. <BR> Okay then.
6617,What'd you say your station...uh your call letters were? <BR> W...B...2...YXB.
6618,What sort of puppy are you looking for? <BR> What sort have you got? <BR> Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand? <BR> Yeah. <BR> We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die we would unburden you you understand? <BR> Yes... Good good... <BR> So what are you looking for? <BR> What about an untrained pup white... <BR> How much of a hurry are you in? <BR> Tomorrow? <BR> Im afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases... <BR> I see. How much? <BR> Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient. <BR> ... Fine. Ill go for the safe place. <BR> Have the money ready by 11am. Well call you.
6619,A <u>man</u> started the fire. <BR> Neil goddamn it you're not five years old!
6620,I do all the work. Somebody don't like it fuck him. <BR> It's up to you. <BR> They want a fuckin' war I'm ready.
6621,What about him? <BR> I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature. <BR> Remember when you asked for a study on him I refused. Same goes for now. <BR> That was Peterson upstairs. <BR> It was you who did the asking. <BR> He doesn't think you run mind games on him. <BR> I wouldn't presume to try. <BR> You're never alone in a room with Graham are you? You're smooth about it but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic? <BR> He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.. and some other points of view that scare and sicken him. <BR> Why aren't you ever alone with him? <BR> Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want? <BR> His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate? <BR> I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in... <BR> That's when it happened? <BR> No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.. but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown. <BR> What's the bottom line? <BR> If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set he may destroy himself.  What are you planning Jack? <BR> Could he handle a direct contact? <BR> I don't recommend it.
6622,What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know... <BR> I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?... <BR> I don't know but when we find her she's gonna die for it.
6623,Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us. <BR> They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
6624,"Can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved? <BR> ... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.  Well, I am not a crook.  I have never made a dime from public service ... <BR> Oh God, I'm going to throw up."
6625,That Casy. He might a been a preacher but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too. <BR> Comes night we'll get outa here.
6626,Look Eric it's your little friends. <BR> What the hell are you guys doing here?
6627,Sir you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside? <BR> Bullshit I ain't goin' anywhere with you! <BR> Bullshit you're out of here cowboy!
6628,Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse... <BR> Oh... <BR> You all settled an' comfortable now?
6629,OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas.  And that's Switzerland's country code. <BR> A bank? <BR> Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa. <BR> Both at the same bank... <BR> And look at the balances...these aren't police salaries...
6630,More than that.  All the songs on the radio were about car crashes. Some kid's banging toy cars together.  She was dialing her cell phone with her headset on.  His car was leaking oil all over the road. <BR> Hey don't be knockin' the Chevette.
6631,See no one's here. Maybe you want to go to the basement? <BR> Maybe we can just watch some TV. <BR> There's a TV in the basement.
6632,How long have you worked for the agency? <BR> Me? Four years. <BR> If you ever want to make it to five you're gonna listen to me real close. Jason Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous. A week ago he assassinated two men in Berlin one of whom was a highly-experienced field officer... 
6633,Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think... <BR> 
6634,They checked in. <BR> Call the ranch tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here -- <BR> Why? <BR> There are three men dead. <BR> So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal. <BR> He might be ready to chop us up. <BR> Do it my way.
6635,I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign. <BR> I will Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself. <BR> I've made so many mistakes Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over. <BR> There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light. <BR> Servis made it through again? <BR> He's like you sir too tough for the Gods to swallow.
6636,Thank you sir I appreciate that. Everybody thanks. Gives some chips as tips to the dealer and box man. Thanks. Take care Steve. Take chances and drive fast. <BR> Ginger honey.
6637,'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation... <BR> ... and now?
6638,Now listen Grampa. Listen to me just a minute. <BR> And I ain't gonna listen either. I tol' you what I'm gonna do.  And I don't give a hoot in a hollow if they's oranges and grapes crowdin' a fella outa bed even I ain't a- goin' to California!  This here's my country. I b'long *here*.  It ain't no good--  --but it's mine.
6639,Well I don't know I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime. <BR> I'd like that.
6640,Where are you going? <BR> Well if you won't let me smoke grass then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.
6641,I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.] <BR> Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma? <BR> What else? I gave her a schaff [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.]
6642,Buffy?  What's wrong? <BR> Oh God.  It's him.  I think it's him. <BR> Who? <BR> Merrick...
6643,Addison... <BR> She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her- <BR> Addison just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted- <BR> - something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars... <BR> I didn't mean just the Theater. <BR> What else?
6644,Sounds good. <BR> You want to try with me? <BR> Things can't get much worse can they? <BR> I don't see how.
6645,Rarest pistol in the world Larry a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured. <BR> Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel. <BR> The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid... <BR> No. This time I'm in for the long term. This is not a liquidation Gordon. I'm going to turn it around. You're getting a free ride on my tail mate and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock I could modernize the plant. I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon. We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers...
6646,Do you feel much about the things you did? <BR> I didn't do anything wrong. <BR> Tell that to Muskie. <BR> Oh maybe nickel and dime stuff. <BR> During the Florida primary you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls. <BR> Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record. <BR> You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians. <BR> I didn't. <BR> But you know who did. <BR> When you guys print it in the paper then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer and I'll probably go to jail and be disbarred and what did I do that was so awful?
6647,Relax Mulvihill glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here? <BR> Hope so. He's working for us.
6648,Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice. <BR> Well what's nice about her? Tell us! <BR> Well she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport ya know for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer. <BR> Isn't that nice? You should bring her home to meet us!
6649,Right here Chief.  Sorry I lost you last night.  Damn thing keeps cutting out. <BR> Dad...Dad... There's... I need to... <BR>  <BR> Something happened something... <BR> What?  Johnny what's wrong? <BR> It's Mom. <BR> What?  What is it? <BR> She's not here. <BR> Whatta you mean she's not here? <BR> She...she died.  It's like it just happened. <BR> She just died your mother just died? <BR> No Dad it happened a long time ago a long time ago for me.
6650,What were they saying? About you? In there? <BR> They say I am no good to you. <BR> You are no good to me -- in jail. <BR> I'd lie on my cot in the cell and I couldn't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. And I'd say to myself think of something nice. Something beautiful. And then I'd think of you. And my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.
6651,You okay champ? <BR> Can we go get Rex now?  The bad man's getting awful close. <BR> I know he is sweetie.  We'll both go get Rex right now.
6652,You want me to buy her? <BR> Shocking huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like
6653,What are you doing here assface? <BR> Checkin' it out
6654,I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away.  <BR> What if nobody stops for us? <BR> Oh they'll stop all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them. <BR> You're an expert I suppose. <BR>  <BR> There's no end to your accomplishments. <BR> You think it's simple huh? <BR> Oh no! <BR> Well it is simple. It's all in the thumb see? A lot of people do it
6655,Is it safe? <BR> Do we care? <BR> I think we Nought to wait. <BR> I say we go. <BR> You say we go? <BR> Do not inhale. <BR> I'm not ready. <BR> Here we go.
6656,And what are we looking for? <BR> I want to know about Treadstone. <BR> To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing. <BR> He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files Ward.
6657,Alright Donald alright but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am. <BR> Don't you see the danger John inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.
6658,The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad Goodall. <BR> Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem Mr. Lawford. <BR> Read on young John.  Read on. College boards are coming.
6659,So you've got it all figured do you? <BR> Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him. <BR> I think not.  I have of course taken the precaution of wiring the briefcase to explode five seconds after it opens.  Unless of course I deactivate it before it goes off.
6660,Neil -- what -- <BR> Mom <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>! <BR> Honey -- <BR> Mom I heard someone downstairs!
6661,Yes. And no more evasive tactics. <BR> It's your best play Nicky. <BR> See Daddy. <BR> I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work. <BR> What else? <BR> An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
6662,Dickie my God! <BR> Hello Meredith. <BR> I was looking at you your clothes I wouldn't have known you... <BR> Well you've spotted me and so you get the reward. <BR> What? <BR> Just kidding. Are you alone? <BR> Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.
6663,The rooms yours for 24 hours. Its sound- proofed stocked up with food drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like. <BR> Anything at all? <BR> Anything at all. I presume you wont want to take the boy with you when youre finished?  Theres a Ł500 fee for disposal. The boy is yours you understand?
6664,Does Johnnie hit on you? <BR> Johnnie hits on anything in high heels. <BR> Has Caesar ever seen him? <BR> He does it right in front of him. <BR> It's getting better and better. Keep going. <BR> Gino doesn't know English or at least he pretends he doesn't so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes had one drink and then they left. <BR> What did Gino drink? <BR> Scotch Glenlivet.  I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it.
6665,Where? <BR> Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke. <BR> Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch? <BR> You did. <BR> Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour? <BR> With that cast on -- you don't. <BR> Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary. <BR> You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert. <BR> Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments. <BR> I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track. <BR> You asked for something dramatically different! You got it! <BR> So did you. Goodbye Jeff. <BR> You've got to get me out of here! Six weeks -- sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors!
6666,How did you know? <BR> Know what? <BR> That there was a gun pointed at me. <BR> I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub and the rest was easy. <BR> But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did? <BR> Because that's what I would have done...
6667,So your mother grew up in Shanghai? <BR> Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine. <BR> And your father? Is he from New York? <BR> Muncie Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here. <BR> Just like me.
6668,Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like? <BR> It doesn't look all that different. <BR> The future doesn't look different? <BR> No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from. <BR> What about the world? <BR> I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
6669,... Thank you. <BR> Unfortunate but I think we can work around it.
6670,I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting. <BR> Where is the meeting going to be? <BR> At the ship.
6671,Huh? <BR> The Ham radio.  That's how come he didn't die in the fire.
6672,Slip it in ... <BR> You're going high-cheese dude -- <BR> Unlock your button ... <BR>  <BR> The alarms go off ... <BR> Woo-woo-wooooo! <BR> I pop your hood; find your siren wires <BR> They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills... <BR>  <BR> Cut 'em... <BR> Now... I'm in ... <BR> Of course you are. You're a professional... <BR> I ratchet your ignition mechanism ... <BR> I bet you say that to all the girls... <BR> With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ... <BR> Wrong preposition... <BR> Hear you roar ... <BR> What about The Club ... ? <BR> Let me worry about The Club ... <BR> No worries ... <BR> I've got you floored... We're off ... Take the curb... Man can you corner... Know not to get on it ... Momentum shift ... Don't get on those brakes too hard ... Get her up on her tires. Up on her toes. Up ... Up... Up.
6673,...all the luck in the world. <BR> You do? <BR> Yeah I do. I mean it's - it's the - it's the best thing you can do right now. I mean this. And you'll have real security.  Sweetheart... you're gonna be situated just right in Vegas.
6674,Are we going to make it? <BR> Hell I don't know... but we sure gave it a run. <BR> Whatever happens... we're going all the way. <BR> Yeah why not? We're the good guys. <BR> I guess we are.
6675,My documentary is due on Tuesday. <BR> What's your subject? <BR> I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
6676,We're gonna change it Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses. <BR> Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
6677,I don't want it anymore. <BR> No? <BR> No. It was an accident. <BR> You mean that's what you're going to call it.
6678,Unguent. <BR> Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb. <BR> I need ...unguent.
6679,How's the stock market? <BR> Up up up. <BR> I'll bet just while we were talking you made like a hundred thousand dollars. <BR> Could be.  Do you play the market? <BR> No - the ukulele.  And I sing. <BR> For your own amusement? <BR> Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators. <BR> You're society girls? <BR> Oh yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark. <BR> Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz? <BR> Yeah.  Real hot. <BR> Oh.  Well I guess some like it hot.  But personally I prefer classical music. <BR> So do I.  as a matter of fact I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music. <BR> Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career? <BR> They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties cotillions - <BR> - Inauguration balls - <BR> - opening of the Opera - <BR> - riding to hounds - <BR> - and always the same Four Hundred. <BR> You know it's amazing we never ran into each other before.  I'm sure I would have remembered anybody as attractive as you. <BR> You're very kind.  I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless - <BR> I beg your pardon? <BR> You see I have this theory about men with glasses. <BR> What theory? <BR> Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight? <BR> Tonight? <BR> I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play. <BR> I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult. <BR> Why? <BR> I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out. <BR> Oh? <BR> It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby. <BR> You collect shells? <BR> Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it. <BR> Shell Oil? <BR> Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.
6680,The jacket Tripp. We need the jacket. <BR> Oh right. Oola. About that jacket...
6681,It's not just a dream.  It's real you moron! I know the date is happens!! <BR> I'm sure it feels very real to you -- <BR> On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day get it? <BR> Relax now Sarah -- <BR> You think you're alive and safe but you're already dead.  Everybody you him...  everybody... you're all fucking dead!
6682,Well that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot Woody. <BR> Have you been replaced?
6683,"Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but I finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin. <BR> I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now?  Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I? <BR> Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D."
6684,Wait. <BR> Find the rockets.  If they're guarded kill the men guarding them.
6685,Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there. <BR> Stop shitting me man!
6686,Oh yes that's right. Did you see the new play? <BR> Oh you remember her Annie. <BR> Yes I do.
6687,I better be getting that. <BR> Duty calls? <BR> Just business.
6688,I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat skipper? <BR> Conveniently enough for you. <BR> Look I didn't touch it. Alright?
6689,Maybe we can mess around. You know only if you want to... <BR> I don't know. <BR> Why did you -- with Sandy? <BR> I don't know. <BR> You like him? He worships you.
6690,Shit!  Shit!  Shit! <BR> It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
6691,Are you ready Ilsa? <BR> Yes I'm ready.  Goodbye Rick. God bless you.
6692,Listen man I think I have a problem. <BR> We all have problems. <BR> I'm pissin' fire man.
6693,Victor I I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here. <BR> If we would walk out so soon it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
6694,I don't know. <BR> What did you think would happen? <BR> I don't know. <BR> What did you want to happen? <BR> I don't know!
6695,You're too close.  Back off. <BR> Goddamnit Hendricks untie the rope there.
6696,Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun. <BR> Oh I'm sure it's a lot of fun 'cause the Incas did it you know and-and they-they-they were a million laughs. <BR> Alvy come on for your own experience. I mean you wanna write why not?
6697,Everything's gonna freeze the big freeze. <BR> Yeah Paul are you gonna get home okay?
6698,"Are you sure I can borrow this? <BR> No please. Go ahead it's your funeral... <BR> Rosa... <BR> Well what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is? <BR> You should have a little faith in people. <BR> Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients the hospital? <BR> All the time. It's always Loma Vista"""" this """"Loma Vista"""" that."""
6699,Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease two day's flour an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn we got to remember she's gonna be due soon. <BR> It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
6700,Whoa!  What the hell was that?! <BR> Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses!
6701,Hell of a show.  Hell of a job Stan. <BR> ...one more day. <BR> Naw naw we own the airways... 
6702,Is there a picture of her somewhere? <BR> No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her? <BR> No. <BR> Couldn't tell she going to off herself huh? <BR> No you couldn't. <BR> I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest. <BR> Really? <BR> Yeah. You should check downstairs. <BR> Why? <BR> People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.
6703,Do you ever look at those girls who work at Swenson's? They're beautiful. And I have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week. <BR> You should work for yourself.
6704,So you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome. <BR> Don't tell me Oprah did a show--
6705,Ellie? Oh she's no responsibility. <BR> No?  Say listenI've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country isn't he? Well I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers statesmen foreign ministerssome of the most powerful people in the worldbut I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listenif you'll do what I tell you perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell. <BR> What would you like to have me do? <BR> Sock her!
6706,Well -- did you get it Thorwald? <BR> Who are you? <BR> I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away. <BR> Why should I? <BR> For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife. <BR> I don't know what you mean. <BR> Now stop wasting time Thorwald or I'll hang up and call the police. <BR> I only have a hundred dollars or so. <BR> That's a start. I'm at the Brevoort now. I'll be looking for you.
6707,What's wrong? <BR> Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
6708,That was over thirty years ago.  I paid for that and then some. <BR> You go to Xavier High School Daryl? <BR> Yeah. <BR> You remember Mary Finelli? <BR> What are you saying? <BR> You know what I'm saying. <BR> No I don't. <BR> Well I think you do.
6709,Yeah. And sex is just like yeah let's have sex. <BR> It's like yeah whatever. But when you fuck. You wanna fuck that person. You're like ripping each other's hair out. Ooooh.

6712,Some crew you got ... <BR> If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?
6713,You've been giving him a *flying* lesson! <BR> He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
6714,It's great that people are interested but if anyone's going to buy anything I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery even if they come to your studio. <BR> Sure.
6715,If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance... <BR> I better go check on them. <BR> Wait Betty... you still haven't answered me. <BR> This is really awkward...
6716,"But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha. <BR> The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future."
6717,You know you've got a nasty reputation Mr. Gittes. I like that. <BR> Thanks. <BR> If you were a bank president that would be one thing but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising. <BR> It doesn't hurt. <BR> It's why you attract a client like my daughter. <BR> Probably. <BR> But I'm surprised you're still working for her unless she's suddenly come up with another husband. <BR> No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
6718,I will never understand it Mickey. You didn't even call the police. <BR> I told you the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will. <BR> I know you will. <BR> Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean if you're having second thoughts my offer still stands. <BR> Thanks Mickey but I need to get out you know?  Get away from all of this.
6719,The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings. <BR> That lucky bastard. <BR> What about the rest of you?  Kimberly you were driving to Daytona.  Was Route 18 your first choice?
6720,No more man. I'm about to drop as it is. <BR> See ya. <BR> Where you going? <BR> Paul let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I'm off to get laid. See you. <BR> Flame on asshole. <BR> And remember with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex -- because you drone on like a motherfucker when you're stoned.
6721,When? When are you going to do it? <BR> Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten-  - and you're going to be on time.
6722,And what's that? <BR> My business? <BR> Yes. <BR> Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison. <BR> You killed him?
6723,Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah listen pal Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda. <BR> Jesus that's in Chinatown ain't it?
6724,I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours! <BR> You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers? <BR> Sort of.
6725,Answer the radio Zebra. You know it's that time. <BR> Four times this week I've had him. Aren't there any other units out there?  Don't answer the radio. They'll give it to someone else. <BR> Thirteen Zebra. One-Three Zebra. You're going out of service in two seconds.
6726,Mmmm ...  thanks I needed this. <BR> My pleasure ...  but to be honest I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor? <BR> A favor? <BR> Yeah see I'm kind of a night person so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools. <BR> Oh I'm sorry -- <BR> No it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin. <BR> Are they really? <BR> Yes it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble I understand ... <BR> No no trouble.  There's other work to do. <BR> You're doing everything yourself? <BR> Yeah. <BR> That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
6727,Let me get you a new copy of the proposal. <BR> That'd be great.
6728,"Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me! <BR> They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be? <BR> ...plenty <BR> Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow? <BR> Mind your own business. You just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer, anyway..."
6729,Hello-- <BR> You ready? <BR> I will be in just a minute. <BR> The picture starts at eight-fifty. <BR> I was talking to Mr. Carpenter. <BR> I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
6730,A time will come when you'll thank me for this. <BR> I won't thank you! I'll never thank you! <BR> Please don't shout. <BR> I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to. <BR> Ah! Coconut layer cake. Nice and gooey too. Just the way I like it.
6731,How much are you worth? <BR> I have no idea. How much do you want? <BR> I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million? <BR> Oh my yes. <BR> Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford? <BR> The future Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago. <BR> Who do you blame for that? Her?
6732,I think I should go back. <BR> Joel come here. Please.
6733,Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight and remove it tomorrow. <BR> Excellent Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man. <BR> His plight is obvious isn't it?
6734,When do I get to see Brad? <BR> After breakfast.  You're sounding tense Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
6735,Nice conversationalist!  Yeah I felt 'em a little but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject. <BR> It's natural.  A reaction to their presence to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them. <BR> Oh wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me. <BR> You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes. <BR> You are such a wet. <BR> A what? <BR> A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'. <BR> Don't start with me again. <BR> Aren't I like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like ever? <BR> Buffy... <BR> And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color. <BR> What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh Buffy you're so special I just want to give you a great big hug oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.' <BR> Oh fuck you!
6736,"Shit, plenty of people did their best writing in prison.  Gandhi, Lenin ... <BR> That's right. <BR> What I know about this country, I ... I could rip it apart.  If they want a public humiliation, that's what they'll get.  But I will never resign this office.  Where the fuck am I?"
6737,It's very good Bernie. <BR> But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
6738,Are you Detective Williams? <BR> Yes. <BR> My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store? <BR> Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he? <BR> He's alright I guess. I hope. They're doing tests that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista I found an ear. <BR> You did? A human ear? <BR> Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you. <BR> Yep that's right. Let's take a look at it.
6739,30 seconds... <BR> Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
6740,Put that shit out... <BR> C'mon man... <BR> I swear to God I'll fucking puke. <BR> Hey Jimmy where they taking us? <BR> Yeah. Where they gonna whack us?
6741,There is no going back. <BR> When I get the Scotch how do I know you won't take off? <BR> The same way I'll know that you went to Scotch.  Trust.
6742,Oh Jesus really? <BR> Oh yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy? <BR> What?
6743,Looks like someone forgot a camera. <BR> Yeah I did. <BR> It's yours? <BR> It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time. <BR> I didn't know you took pictures. <BR> I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it but I do it every day. Rain or shine sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job and my job is just a way to support my hobby. <BR> So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter. <BR> That's what people see but that ain't necessarily what I am. <BR> How'd you get started? <BR> Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one. <BR> A photographer ... <BR> Well let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap. <BR> I'd like to see your pictures some day. <BR> It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share my pictures with you.  It would be an honor.
6744,One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one. <BR> Yeah. And? <BR> It's just funny...who needs a serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw when we have ourselves.
6745,'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women! <BR> So what am I supposed to do? <BR> You could still always give Becker an itch. 'Course you might get killed when he goes to scratch it but seems to me you're saying that's about to happen anyway. [Beat] Just be careful not to walk yourself right into something.
6746,I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing she'll want to talk to me all day but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting I can be out quick. if anything happens I'll be in apartment 16M. <BR> Maybe I should come up with you. <BR> If I'm not back in fifteen minutes hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go. <BR> Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you. <BR> No I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend.
6747,Heh heh heh!  Golly bob howdy -- <BR> Oh shut up!  In a couple of days everything will be just the way it was.  They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
6748,Okay thanks.  Um... you know that's it. I'm sorry. <BR> Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin' partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time. <BR> No problem.  Sorry. <BR> You bet.
6749,Right!  That's what we're shooting for.  Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department but right now relations with the Turks aren't too good Nixon's upset the hell out of them. Our best bet's... right here. <BR> Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this I Promise. <BR> Don't worry about it.  Right now money doesn't count. Okay?
6750,Buddy? ... <BR> You should be going ... the primaries are soon aren't they?  New Hampshire ... <BR> They love you Buddy.  They need you too. <BR> I don't want them to love me. <BR> I need you out there.  It won't be like last time.  The war's crippled the Democrats.  I can win ... We deserve it.  Yeah it's ours Buddy -- at last.  Nobody knows better than you.  Frank Nixon's boy.
6751,Where the hell were you? <BR> Late. <BR> I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal?
6752,"Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here. <BR> There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair..."
6753,Excuse me Counselor Wendy I need assistance in finding that important...thingie in the storage room. <BR> Oh my gosh why didn't you say something earlier...
6754,This won't take long. I'm shooting tomorrow morning. I just need to do some prep work. <BR> I don't mind waiting.
6755,Oh I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why - <BR> Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
6756,The one with the V.P.L. <BR> V.P.L.? <BR> Visible panty line. Max she is gorgeous. <BR> Yeah she's a ten Max and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos aren't you? <BR> There are no twos Max. <BR> Yeah you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering. <BR> M'hm. <BR> And... uh- <BR> How do you like this couple Max?
6757,Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli. <BR> What do you want with old man Faz?
6758,I said no touching. <BR> Look man I'm the bachelor alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone -- <BR> Get your hands off of her. <BR> Dude listen man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment? <BR> Your dance is over. <BR> Come on dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill I'll wear a rubber --
6759,Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags! <BR> There might be some extras in the garage.
6760,"Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job. <BR> I'm <u>doing</u> my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me doing here.  What <u>is</u> it you thought <u>you</u> were doing?"
6761,Mr. Smith I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph. <BR> Well well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around gal! Let's get a look at you. <BR> There you are! <BR> Well daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto? <BR> I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw. <BR> Aw you wanted to see some life in the raw huh? Well gal I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here. <BR> Well I'll have to look someplace else. <BR> No no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies or perhaps some slightly fried pansies or better still some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck. <BR> Say who's been tying your ties lately? It looks rotten.
6762,Happy Birthday. <BR> Thanks Joely. A present! Oh boy!
6763,Oh it's great. You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks. <BR> What kind of show? <BR> Think of the weirdest craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life. <BR> Can we talk about this later? <BR> The jizz-mopper's job is to clean up the booths afterward because practically everybody shoots a load against the window and I don't know if you know or not but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away.
6764,Guy hit the shit outta that one eh? <BR> Well I held it like an egg. <BR> An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet? <BR> I'm having a blast.  God that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball. <BR> He did know. <BR> How? <BR> I told him.
6765,Oh I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out. <BR> That's right. <BR> I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army. <BR> In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself. <BR> But I suppose you know the answer. <BR> It's really quite simple... The three- body problem you know.
6766,So I just heard her cries for help and all that and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there so I just stood around really waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all I think. I didn't actually see anything useful I don't think. <BR> did you hear anything before he cries? <BR> No not that I recall I was asleep. <BR> Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days? <BR> No nothing sorry. <BR> Well if you do you'll let us know? <BR> Of course. <BR> And the other three people on the flat did they hear anything? <BR> There are only two other people in the flat.
6767,Look I have to go. I have to think. <BR> Joel we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?

6776,How much do you remember? <BR> It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.

6778,The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me. <BR> I decided it this morning. <BR> Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that -- <BR> I am King d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish! <BR> But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous -- <BR> Let us play a game d'Artagnan let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us behave as if my wish is law.  And my wish is to enjoy this party!
6779,Commodus must hate you.  Free your gladiators and come with us. <BR> Are you mad?  With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night!  Anyway I'm not political I'm in the entertainment business.
6780,Sure... you're a fine boy Ken you really are. <BR> Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night. <BR> Good night
6781,The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation. <BR> Why him? <BR> In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor. <BR> Then what?
6782,I need an extension for my case. <BR> You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared. <BR> I had a witness disappear on me. <BR> That happens. <BR> I could subpoena him if I had a week. <BR> I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
6783,Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room and not realize he'd been there the whole time. <BR> Was he morose or...?  I mean... <BR> No.  What happened... no one expected it. <BR> Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me. <BR> Not much I think. <BR> I'm just like him. <BR> You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately but don't make me start worrying about you. <BR> Did you worry about him? <BR> Nobody worried about your father.
6784,About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her too. <BR> Well... <BR> Let's not fumble for excuses not here and now with my hair down. At best let's say I've been oversensitive to... well to the fact that she's so young - so feminine and helpless. To so many things I want to be for Bill... funny business a woman's career. The things you drop on your way up the ladder so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman. That's one career all females have in common - whether we like it or not - being a woman. Sooner or later we've all got to work at it no matter what other careers we've had or wanted... and in the last analysis nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed - and there he is. Without that you're not woman. You're something with a French provincial office or a book full of clippings - but you're not a woman...  ... slow curtain. The end.
6785,Time for lunch. <BR> Angelo it's eleven thirty. <BR> That place up the street has meatball sandwiches.  Get me two.
6786,Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks? <BR> Hey Joe! <BR> Suppose Lake Michigan overflows? <BR> Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
6787,Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*? <BR> Uh sure--that's what Kong thinks all right. <BR> That's why Kong loves her!
6788,"I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del? <BR> There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared! <BR> You never gave us a chance... <BR> I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words."
6789,You were convicted of the crime. <BR> That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it I'm not going to accept that I did. <BR> You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged. <BR> No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind.
6790,Is it bad? <BR> We get out of this alive maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.
6791,Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat -- <BR> I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat? <BR> Bird!
6792,The hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable... <BR> So? <BR> So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet? <BR> Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
6793,At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you. <BR> Ah well .... CUT TO:
6794,What? <BR> Zurich police are looking for an American with a red bag.  Apparently he put two cops in the hospital last night.

I say again our records indicate the passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea. Over. <BR> Roger North Island. Please advise pending further information. Over. <BR> Affirmative Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coast Guard North Island Station. Over and out.
6797,They'll be waiting for us at the airport. <BR> You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us. <BR> We have to find Sophie.
6798,Give'em another pill... <BR> No.  No.  He didn't mean anything by it at <u>all</u>... <BR> Hello?   No operator...
6799,I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway. <BR> Thanks Stan. I owe you.
6800,What? <BR> I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea. <BR> Your idea? Well that fits. I mean the two of you that fits together. I should have seen that long ago.
6801,Thanks Marv I'll make it good to you.  You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone... <BR> Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something?
6802,Yessiree Bob. <BR> Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.
6803,So you just got out? <BR> Jesus Caesar! <BR> What?  It ain't no big fuckin' deal. I know who Don hires.  Did you know he did time himself?
6804,I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later. <BR> I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
6805,Lane's closed big fellah league night. <BR> I'm not here to bowl. <BR> You drag that coconut around for your health or do you know how to use it? <BR> I'm looking for somebody.
6806,Nothing sticks to slime Emily.  This should cover what you lent me. <BR> Huh! And they say charitys only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ...
6807,Blade's unique you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight garlic even silver. But he still has the Thirst. <BR> What happens if he doesn't take the serum? <BR> The Thirst overcomes him just like the others. It's not something he can control.  The problem is time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure -- <BR> No offense Whistler but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something. <BR> Which is why you're here. We could use someone with your experience.
6808,So what's the problem? <BR> ...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud this is a heavy... <BR> ....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags Gekko's always getting checked by them they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this... <BR> Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile no lunches... we suspend our business alright... <BR> Sure Roger whatever you want it's cool.
6809,You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now. <BR> You gotta plan these things. <BR> And I got it all planned.
6810,Who cares? <BR> Now now. He's a good boy. <BR> Shit. We don't know what he is. <BR> Jack you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
6811,Okay how do you want to do it? <BR> I want someone I know to take me in. <BR> Who? <BR> There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
6812,"General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately. <BR> I don't know anything about that. <BR> Well, call General McAddie. <BR> I don't have his number. <BR> They can patch you in through the switchboard."
6813,Frankly Carl I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen. <BR> There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know. <BR> I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb? <BR> No it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions.  I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ...
6814,Oh hi. <BR> Hi I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see -- <BR> I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry. <BR> Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know. <BR> Of course. Please have a seat.
6815,No faith in our new-found goodness Detective ...? <BR> Sure. But sometimes we got to create some numbers. The task force is run by statistics you know ...
6816,I mean the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History. <BR> But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner. <BR> So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it. <BR> This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in. <BR> Phil I can understand. You're in the finances you're upstairs but you are not on the floor. I got thousands of players. I got five hundred dealers.  They're all lookin' to rob me blind twenty-four hours a day. I have to let them know I'm watching all the details all the time; that there is not one single thing I will not catch as I am over here.
6817,I know it's late. I -- Are you there? <BR> Yes Bruce -- I'm here -- <BR> I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you. <BR> Well Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible. <BR> I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider. <BR> I wish you'd...
6818,But what? <BR> Oh I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know like in the movies. <BR> That's the problem.  When you're a kid you think life is gonna be like the movies.  Dreams come true the good guys win people live happily ever after... all that crap.  Turn.
6819,He's fine as long as he gets his medication. <BR> Speaking of that...  We're gonna need a whole lot <u>more</u> of this....
6820,That's alright.  Don't misunderstand my husband.  It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth? <BR> But what is the truth? <BR> I don't know all about what happened back then.  But it always stood between me and my husband.
6821,He's tough your American friend. <BR> Yes Sam's tough alright. <BR> And you respect him. <BR> Of course.  Don't you? <BR> I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop? <BR> Not exactly. <BR> Not exactly?  But close enough eh?  So he saved your life then? <BR> How did you know? <BR> If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.
6822,Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about? <BR> Right. <BR> Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it? <BR> Right. <BR> Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme. <BR> Gee that's an idea Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now... <BR> Oh sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine... <BR> And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you! <BR> What could I be? <BR> You could be something.  I've got an idea Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal get me a cigarette will you? <BR> Here you are. <BR> All right thanks. Now let's see. How will I start? Hey pal how would you start?
6823,Was the Baron joking or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits. <BR> Absolutely true Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately. <BR> If the Baron -- if you would permit me --
6824,She she's alone. Just go. Take the gun and go into Amy's. <BR> You get down here! <BR> Just wait there for me! <BR> Get down here and talk to me goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker!
6825,Good morning. <BR> Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
6826,Hello? <BR> Who is this? What's going on? <BR> This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor. <BR> Where's Ken? Is he all right?
6827,Let me clarify things for you Jeanne.  On the one hand there is the Church Triumphant that is to say God his saints and the souls that are saved.  And then there is the Church Militant that is to say our Holy Father the Pope the cardinals the prelates of the Church the clergy and all good Catholic Christians.  Moreover this Church when assembled is guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore cannot be in error.  That is why we ask you to submit to the Church Militant... that is to say us. <BR> So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
6828,Oh dear....easy honey... <BR> Ninety-five miles an hour...
6829,What are ya thinkin'? <BR> Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die. <BR> You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families! <BR> They're friends of our enemy. <BR> Take one of 'em out and they'll all line up against us. <BR> Not if they all die at once.
6830,I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --? <BR> What? <BR> The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you. <BR> I want to be alone. <BR> That is not the truth.  You do not want to be alone -- you're afraid of being alone -- I know you're afraid. I know you. You were desperate just now if I go away you'll be more desperate than ever. Say I am to stay with you... say it. 
6831,But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it though. Depends on how you feel. For instance number one is a short jerky movement  That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket see? <BR> Clever. <BR> Number two is a wider movementa smile goes with that onelike this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12] <BR> You figured that all out yourself huh? <BR> Oh that's nothing. Now take number three for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're brokeand hungryand everything looks black. It's a long movement like this  with a follow through. <BR> Amazing. <BR> Hm? Yeah but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
6832,To what? <BR> The prison man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
6833,And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'? <BR> OK so A has left you B is ambivalent you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.
6834,Is there something the matter with it? <BR> Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big. <BR> Well it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn don't you? <BR> Yes... oh yes... <BR> Then I expect you'll be leaving first thing in the morning.
6835,This Ruiz guy what's his deal? <BR> Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship. <BR> Yeah? <BR> Understand me? <BR> Yeah.
6836,Walter what did you do while taking a nap with your sister? <BR> Nothing. <BR> Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes? <BR> This is garbage! <BR> I'm only asking questions. <BR> Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair. <BR> What else? <BR> That's all. I just liked smelling her hair. <BR> You felt pleasure. <BR> Yes.
6837,For Christ's sake why? <BR> To recover the mind set.
6838,Why are they singing Mama? <BR> They are singing for me. <BR> Can we light the candles now? On the cake? <BR> Yes. We will light the candles.
6839,What did you get? <BR> I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change. <BR> When? <BR> Now. <BR> Now? <BR> He wants me to come to his quarters. <BR> A shift change should come through the scheduling office.
6840,You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all. <BR> You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
6841,Lykas pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action... <BR> Do you want posters too?
6842,I won't let her in. I'm sorry Randy I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well I'm not gonna let her in the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm - <BR> Not gonna let me in? <BR> Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you - <BR> What do you mean what am I gonna do? I'm in the same clothes for two days! I want to get a few of my things! Big deal!
6843,Go ahead Senor.  I have my friend to keep me company. <BR> I'll be back when I can.
6844,What is she saying? <BR> She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
6845,If they can get this on the tube by eleven she may just call us.  How do I look? <BR> Like shit boss.
6846,You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance and we were sort of wondering did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse? <BR> I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
6847,How much you pay this joker... this cab driver? <BR> Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred. <BR> How much did you figure to make?
6848,Yeah how did you know? <BR> I just know that's all. I remember you from Central.
6849,Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework! <BR> Oh really?
6850,Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her! <BR> Jake you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.
6851,Excuse me. You are a very kind man. I can see that. A man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water. <BR> I can't. I have to stay with my patient.
6852,So what's the biggest?  Waimea? <BR> No Bells Beach Australia.
6853,You all right? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Why're you crying? <BR> I'm not crying. 
6854,Article 42!  You don't mean-?! <BR> Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you. <BR> But I- <BR> You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
6855,Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never ever never let you go. <BR> Let's lock off this room.
6856,No way that cocksucker's driving you. <BR> Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime I gotta feed my little girl. <BR> Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin. <BR> Ho's a good guy -- <BR> Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife! <BR> Shhh. He'll hear you. <BR> Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you! <BR> Listen to me Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay. <BR> I want you to quit. <BR> Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through. <BR> I'll support you. <BR> With what? <BR> Max offered to stake me. <BR> Yeah well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is.
6857,I don't know I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies. <BR> Sir Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee. <BR> No you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify. <BR> Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up. <BR> We are covering up!  For some petty stupid shit.  There are things I can say -- when other people say them they'd be lies. But when I say them nobody believes me anyway ...
6858,You want some research flu?  Side-effects of medi.... <BR> Naw we can't play this one catch-up.  That's how long since you stopped beating the wife.  We have to...
6859,A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The young girl in the movie tears off running SCREAMING flying through the room. <BR> 
6860,Turn on the flashlight. <BR> I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
6861,How's that? We can't drink our piss can we? <BR> Hang on hang on sorry but like who are you? <BR> You must find some glasses small for the toast and some plates. <BR> What are you doing here?
6862,Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there? <BR> I wouldn't think of leaving Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...? <BR> I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion. <BR> Actually I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts. <BR> Do you really think you have a chance against us Mr. Cowboy?
6863,It's a beautiful picture of her. <BR> Why are there two deeds here?
6864,And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower we need to be out in the field as close to the animals as possible. <BR> I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did. <BR> Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas jackals nearly all species of predator birds -- <BR> That doesn't say a thing about T-rex they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were. <BR> We've got to see one to find out. Is there any --
6865,"Good luck, genius... <BR> Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do."
6866,Alone at last. <BR> Now where were we? <BR> I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want - <BR> Thanks don't mind if I do. <BR> Your boss even said there wasn't a set up. <BR> First off I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
6867,Utah you copy bruddah? <BR> Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah! <BR> I'll take that as a yes.
6868,I... feel.... pretty. <BR> No offense man but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something. <BR> The sun!  It burns!  It burns!
6869,It's not the girl Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now but your life won't be worth a dime. <BR> I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.
6870,Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day anyhow right? <BR> Not exactly. I mean he never paid me. <BR> You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment. <BR> Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer do I? <BR> No of course not. Just say it that's all.
6871,Nice work fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius. <BR> Woody!
6872,...We will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours no matter how low how vile... <BR> ...embarrassing shameful... <BR> ...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive ape-like state... <BR> The stone age. <BR> The post-Vegas Man. <BR> A mutant species. <BR> Okay boys smile!
6873,Is this finished yet? <BR> I don't know. <BR> When's your show? <BR> Not sure. How was yours? <BR> I haven't decided yet.  Rene you wanna come over to the studio tomorrow. I wanna make a painting of you.
6874,Hey slow down. This is my brother's car. <BR> I thought he was out of town. <BR> He is. <BR> Then don't hassle it.
6875,Did he say anything about my sister? <BR> Just what he told your detective.
6876,We gonna live here? <BR> Why sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out. <BR> I like the tent better. <BR> This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.
6877,What about your wife? <BR> What about her?  Let's c ut up the money I want to get North.
6878,What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way? <BR> It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it. <BR> I heard you talking. You got fired this morning didn't you? <BR> Look that's temporary believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
6879,If you say a word in English Vincent my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you and that's a price I'm not willing to pay. <BR> I take it you still want the money... <BR> Of course.
6880,My father used to talk about you. <BR> Oh yeah what'd he say?
6881,Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ... <BR> No problem -
6882,What are those for? <BR> Oh it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause but I don't have anybody to go with... <BR> Umm...
6883,I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems. <BR> Yippy. <BR> Who are you spying on? <BR> Take a look for yourself.
6884,Hey I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths. <BR> You think this is all a joke? <BR> Oh please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island? <BR> Ian's a very good friend of mine. <BR> He doesn't need a friend he needs a shrink. <BR> I believe in him.
6885,"Never try to outguess Margo. <BR> Groom. <BR> Yes, dear. <BR> You know what I'm going to be? <BR> A cowboy. <BR> A married lady. <BR> With the paper to prove it. <BR> I'm going to have a home. Not just a house I'm afraid to stay in... and a man to go with it. I'll look up at six o'clock - and there he'll be... remember, Karen?"
6886,It's bone dry Morty. <BR> It's not completely dry. <BR> Yeah well he ain't gonna drown in a damp riverbed either I don't care how soused he was. That's like drowning in a teaspoon.
6887,You know where to look for your Austrian right? <BR> I know where to look. <BR> I might come back I might not. But if I do it wont be for a couple of hours.
6888,That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long . the police are watching. <BR> Where are they? <BR> I don't know. you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
6889,"...Nothing. <BR> What do we do? <BR> If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him. <BR> Chum? <BR> Only one sure way to find him -- offer him a little something to eat. Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, anything. They can sense it miles away. If he's out there, we might be able to get a closer look at him.  It's a good time, too. They're night feeders..."
6890,I know you don't think much of being needed or of me for that matter... <BR> I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary. <BR> No I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry. <BR> No. You warned me. I didn't listen but you warned me.
6891,Such power exists? <BR> I assure you such power exists.
6892,Uh huh. <BR> Would you um say it's a big storm? <BR> Sometimes it gets exciting out here.
6893, <BR> Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
6894,Sorry you had to see that. You were saying? <BR> I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder but her memory of it is gone at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are? <BR> No... Friends from the diner maybe? <BR> Well you should find out. She keeps talking about them...
6895,Then tell me please -- help me...! <BR> Don't think so. Stay the fuck back. <BR> Please! I need your help. <BR> Not even for a million dollars Mr. Price.
6896,Oh right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne? <BR> It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him. <BR> You're sure... <BR> I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
6897,I did. <BR> Who the fuck is he? <BR> -- a fucking cop.
6898,That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say all right. <BR> That's right. I know you understand how I feel Homer--you is breakin' them rules too. Ain't that right?
6899,Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot? <BR> Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it running from the bathroom into the living room grabbing the phone.
6900,You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works I haven't lived here a year yet. <BR> We need a sympathetic face.
6901,Put it this way: if it's your face on that tape Mr. Moses we're one gunshot away from solving all our problems -- <BR> -- fuck you!
6902,You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody do you hear? <BR> No I really do. I think he's gonna kill me. <BR> You just relax and call me back here in exactly an hour on this phone and I'll see what I can do. <BR> Yeah uh-huh... Okay.
6903,I can just barely see him.  I think he's leaving. <BR> Impossible!
6904,Look Bobby I don't know what happened and I don't want to know what happened but something's up. <BR> What are you talking about? <BR> Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today. <BR> They were grabbing her fucking ass -- <BR> Hey. I don't know I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned you're a good kid. I got news though without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep. <BR> Do me a favor Arthur keep him on til I see what's happening. <BR> Good luck.
6905,He said something about being between things. <BR> Yeah between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
6906,Thanks for that. He all right? <BR> I think so... What about you? <BR> Me? Sure. Why? <BR> Just checking.
6907,Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha! <BR> Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that! <BR> Back!  Back you savages!  Back!
6908,He would have loved this. <BR> Your father? <BR> All his years at sea he never stopped talking about these islands. <BR> You miss him.
6909,Steed <BR> How did you guess? <BR> You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ... <BR> It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
6910,On a passenger ship in 1953? <BR> If they knew what they were carrying.
6911,"Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs. <BR> What do you mean, walked? <BR> Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. Those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice Age. In the form of an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. Using us as hosts. Against this we have no defense. Nothing but a weak vaccine.  Do you see why it was kept secret? Why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known?"
6912,Six rounds. 357. <BR> That's what it looks like doesn't it? But that's what a ten gauge choke-bored shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away.
6913,Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's? <BR> I suppose we'll make an appearance. <BR> And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
6914,I just want to be let alone that's all. Life's swell if you don't try too hard. Most people want to get a strangle-hold on it. They're not living. They're just feverish.  If they didn't get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values they'd find what they want. Peace and calm. When you get right down to it what's all the shootin' for will you tell me? After all you can only eat three meals a day only sleep in one bed  Right now that hay feels pretty good to you doesn't it? Sure it does. 'Cause you were tiredand it's the only thing around. <BR> You sound like a hobo.
6915,Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort? <BR> Um hi? <BR> Leah just told me you were going with her. <BR> Yeah I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana then the prom then Vijay's parents' cabin.
6916,He doesn't have a temperature. <BR> I can't help it if my homework is torn to shreds three times a week by someone <u>much</u> bigger than me</u>.
6917,What are you doing? <BR> What are you doing? <BR> I know you're not calling Jimmy. <BR> As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that? <BR> We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month. <BR> You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
6918,Bad for your health anyway. <BR> Who are you then? <BR> Just the fly in the ointment Hans. The monkey in the wrench the pain in the ass -
6919,It isn't necessary. <BR> Uh uh! My boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better sign in and get a receipt.
6920,But who would run the store? <BR> Forget the store. Think big.
6921,Professor Tripp...? <BR> Yes James. <BR> Even if I end up going to jail....
6922,Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen? <BR> Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home fifty years old and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
6923,Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out -- <BR> There's a tunnel.
6924,I should go. <BR> I don't remember any of this. <BR> Jason...
6925,This is getting real old John.  And I'm tired up to here with it... <BR> I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I... <BR> And I'm tired of the I'm sorrys.  I don't need 'em.  What I need is a partner I can count on.  I care about you.  Not cause of me and your old man.  Not cause of your mom. But because of you.
6926,Maybe you outta lay off a little... <BR> Gordo I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to him it was real.
6927,Listen -- what are you doing later? <BR> Fooling around? <BR> Right.
6928,What are you doing here?  Is anything wrong? <BR> No....I though  I'm afraid. <BR> You're not cleared for this precinct.  Let's cross over first.
6929, A slight a slight well no we're gonna <u>deal</u> with it we just I need a little readjustment...we need to re<u>think</u>... <BR> Yes William Uh we have this <u>thing</u> we're doing...
6930,... and maybe the king will give you some money and a little land and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You a lady of title! <BR> I'm staying Jean. <BR> No you must come Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now a white one just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you! <BR> I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me... <BR> Jeanne you can't leave us like this!
6931,Are you okay? <BR> I'm fine. <BR> Do you want me to stick around? <BR> It's okay. <BR> Or I could come back.
6932,You can't believe how much he's improved. <BR> How many times have you shocked him tonight? <BR> Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours. <BR> What do you do just have someone follow him around with a defribilator? <BR> That's good Frank. No but they might surgically implant one about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing isn't it? <BR> A medical miracle.
6933,I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'... <BR> It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police? <BR> No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast and I... I should've called the police. <BR> He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash... <BR> I ought to call the police right now! <BR> No. <BR> Why not? Sam is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money? <BR> How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us... <BR> She haven't even called you? <BR> I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that! <BR> I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand. <BR> You've led a charmed life. <BR> No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle... <BR> Maybe we can handle it together.  <BR> I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know she may be trying to get in touch with me at home. I'd better go home. <BR> I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here. <BR> You want me to stay here? <BR> She'll need both of us. <BR> Where... can I stay? <BR> First rate hotel fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
6934,You and CY have a nice talk? He tell you about Sunrise Enterprises helping people? Well I've seen him hurt people. Why are you following me? <BR> Because you can barely walk.
6935,You don't? <BR> No. What is happening? <BR> Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you. <BR> Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go. <BR> Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you. <BR> Then don't talk about killing. <BR> Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die. <BR> Don't say that. <BR> It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now. <BR> O.K.
6936,Yeah. <BR> What? <BR> When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie I'd love to run into you on the street.  Why aren't you coming? <BR> That's none of your fucking business.
6937,Come on Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that! <BR> You really want me to put all this stuff back on? <BR> Yes. I think so. Show some pride Hamilton.
6938,You haven't heard from Rashid have you? <BR> Not a peep. <BR> I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary. <BR> That could be a good sign though. It could mean that he got away. <BR> Or didn't.  There's no way of knowing is there?
6939,Ahh it's too late anyway. It's too late.  Listen I could shoot my way out maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back. <BR> I'd rather not... <BR> Betty I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out. <BR> ...what're you saying? <BR> When a Roman general knew a battle was lost he'd throw himself on his sword.
6940,Loose machines are right back over there. <BR> What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there. <BR> Okay I'll - <BR> What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden. <BR> Well... <BR> These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off. <BR> Yeah okay. <BR> The action is in the front not in the back. Bring 'em up front. <BR> All right I will I will. <BR> Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way the wrong way and the way I do it. You understand? <BR> I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you. <BR> Don't thank me just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this. <BR> Dang you are right Mr Rothstein I am so sorry.
6941,Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall. <BR> Outstanding.
6942,This story is beyond belief which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months. <BR> I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened. <BR> You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer. <BR> What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who... <BR> Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident. <BR> That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?
6943,Jen - you don't wanna talk about it? <BR> It's you and Mom that need to talk. <BR> Sure.  You're right.
6944,What? <BR> I would be awfully glad to oblige you've been so decent to me. Three hundred? <BR> If I could get into a game I might win some. <BR> Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me. <BR> If we could scare up some men to play. <BR> We could come to my room. <BR> Good!
6945,Try and understand this. I'm a decent Republican. I believe in Richard Nixon. I worked in the White House four years--so did my wife. What happened on June 17 I don't think the President knew anything about. Some of his men I'm not so sure of. <BR> Do you think the truth will come out at the trial? <BR> That's another of the things I'm not so sure of. <BR> Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors? <BR>  <BR> To cover up? <BR> Well they sure didn't ask us to come forward and tell the truth.
6946,Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya... <BR> Look?
6947,What are you thinking? <BR> Before this I turned on the faucet it came out hot and cold I didn't think there was a thing to it.
6948,I don't think your new outfit suits you Theo. <BR> Really? I kinda like it.
6949,You see?  What's the lesson here?  <u>Never</u> give up. <u>Never</u> give up. <BR> No.  You're right. <BR> Show Must Go On. <BR> A proud tradition. <BR> Prouder of this than anything I ever did in my life. I want to thank you Ron.  Want to thank you.
6950,It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future. <BR> Fine with fucking me we got work to do. I don't care what it takes we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  I don't know about the rest of you guys but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.  I don't mean that in like a literal way...
6951,But one thing I could never understand was that she could have everything under control except for her old pimp boyfriend Lester Diamond. <BR> Look Gin you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing.  Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay?
6952,The lighthouse is a make-out spot. <BR> Now I really want to see it. <BR> You going to fool around with Mike?  Well I'm not doing anything with him.
6953,Your bleeding has stopped. <BR> How did -  It's nothing. A scratch. <BR> Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill? <BR> Why? Do you know something about him? <BR> I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me. <BR>  <BR>  <BR> If you didn't kill him then who did? <BR> Who can say...? Best thing for him really. His therapy was going nowhere. <BR> Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find? <BR> And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him Clarice? May I call you Clarice? <BR> Scared at first. Then - exhilarated. <BR> Ahhh... Why? <BR> Because you weren't wasting my time. <BR> Do you have something you use when you need to get up your courage? Memories tableaux... scenes from your early life? <BR> I don't know. Next time I'll have to check. <BR> Jack Crawford is helping your career isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him too. <BR> I never thought about it. <BR> Your first lie to me Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you sexually? True he's much older but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios exchanges...? Fucking you? <BR> That doesn't interest me Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask. <BR> Not anymore.  Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you Clarice. Crawford dangles you before me. Then I give you a bit of help. Do you think it's because I like to look at you and imagine how good you would taste...? <BR> I don't know. Is it? <BR> Or doesn't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of... negotiation? There's something Crawford can give me and I want to trade for it. I even wrote to him offering my help. But he hates me so he won't deal directly.
6954,Ze alarms! Zey went off! <BR> Yeah... That was my bad sorry.
6955,And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears. <BR> That little party's gonna make you a lotta money. <BR> MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT! <BR> Didn't know you felt that way.
6956,Masseria's tryin' ta find a way around ya. But his patience won't hold out much longer. <BR> How's Bugsy doin'? <BR> Tommy Reina's hauntin' his dreams. But he'll do his job.
6957,Goddamn! How long have we had this fucking dog?!  Two years he still doesn't come!  We need a dog that looks happy when the press is around. <BR> Well he's photogenic.  Let's try dog bones?
6958,You're a monster. <BR> Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
6959,Anything? <BR> Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff-- <BR> --in other words you got nothing you're thumbsucking. <BR> Could develop. <BR> Let me see what you get but don't jump--The New York Times thinks it's crazy Cubans.
6960,Need a lift? <BR> No thank you. <BR> How are you today? <BR> Give it up. <BR> Oh right last night. I guess I owe you an apology. <BR> I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me. <BR> I said I was sorry.
6961,The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift. <BR>  <BR> Oh for goodness' sake! <BR> And I thought you said it was something special...
6962,You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already. <BR> Why somebody's complaining? <BR> I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book. <BR> That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone. <BR> Bullshit or no bullshit they put you in that book you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you. <BR> What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin' that's all. <BR> I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you. <BR> All right.
6963,I just can't absorb it all. This place the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask? <BR> I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me. <BR> If you don't mind my asking... Who's close to you?
6964,This is from three years ago. Some difference huh? <BR> What is the Northcountry Development Association? <BR> I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain Wade. $364000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league. <BR> Twombley involved? <BR> No. <BR> He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed. <BR> All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two you won't recognize this town.
6965,Sure you do -- you win either way. <BR> I'm supposed to.
6966,He got it in the belly. He's still alive but won't be for long. <BR> Enough! You better start talkin' to us asshole cause we got shit we need to talk about. We're already freaked out we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.
6967,Why were you yelling like that?! <BR> What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here... <BR> Why?  Are you waiting for someone else? <BR> Yes! <BR> Who?
6968,Don't ever do that again. <BR> All right. <BR> I don't like nobody behind my back! <BR> I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
6969,Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood the same as you.  To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do.  It is against the laws of God and of France. <BR> Get out of my way. <BR> Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man this prisoner... your brother. <BR> Forgive?! <BR> Aramis Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them. <BR> They have plotted against me!  Me! The embodiment of God's will!
6970,Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it please! <BR> All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean?

I'm making this my personal mission. <BR> David isn't hiding from me I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm... <BR> Fuck the details they're always to blame... Look too many of these guys duck out on us especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your you know fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should. <BR> Rosa I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
6974,Yes. Yes it does. <BR> It means concentration of ambition desire and sacrifice such as no other profession demands... And I'll agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms can't be ordinary can't be - just someone. To give so much for almost always so little...
6975,Who? <BR> The...  <BR>  <BR> Is that true? <BR> How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point? <BR> ...going to War... <BR>  <BR> I never won an Oscar. <BR> N'it's a crying shame.  But you <u>staged</u> the Oscars... <BR> Yes.  Indeed I did.  <BR> You know you're a <u>writer</u> that's your script.  You're a <u>director</u>...  But if you're the <u>producer</u> ... what did you do?  What did you do?  All you've got is the <u>credit</u>...  Some plaque on the wall... <BR> And <u>if</u> you never won an Oscar How'd you like an ambassadorship...  <BR> Hell I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it for a story to tell... <BR> Well no well you couldn't <u>tell</u> any... <BR>  <BR> ...that's what it is. <BR>  <BR> It's Miss America N'you're Bert Parks.  <BR> ...Yoha Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania? <BR> Because. <BR> They got to have something that we want. <BR> I'm sure they do. <BR> What do we have that they want? <BR>  <BR> Why would they want that?
6976,The hell I did! <BR> The hell you didn't! <BR> The hell I did! <BR> You said one in two marriages end in divorce. <BR> I never heard that.
6977,Not even a Joey I'm glad to see you? Joey what happened to your leg? <BR> Joey you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid? <BR> Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid? <BR> Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast? <BR> For juice I gotta rebuild. That's not fast.
6978,We fight she gets the clown-- how's that happen? <BR> Shut up--I like this song...  April in Paris this is a feeling No one can ever reprieve... <BR> She's playing with my mind. <BR> It's a damn easy thing to play with.
6979,Now wait a minute Sam. You sure you saw an old woman? <BR> Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me. <BR> And you want to tell me you saw Norman Bates' mother.
6980,It was some guy called Brian. <BR> Did he sound upset? <BR> A little bit. Is that good or bad? <BR> It's an improvement.
6981,Thanks hon. Time to shove off. <BR> Love ya Margie.
6982,Why do you think I'm sending him home? <BR> He killed the dolphin.
6983,... babies. <BR> You mean babies with you? <BR> What's wrong with me? <BR> You're your own baby.
6984,That's right! Goddamn you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son. <BR> He didn't either.
6985,We're talking my dear about a calculated risk which is the only option left to us.  We will never find the command NEDRY used.  He covered his tracks far too well and I think it's obvious he's not coming back.  So shutting down the system - - <BR> I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else because I will not. <BR> - - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct? <BR> Theoretically yeah  but we've never shut down the whole system.  It may not come back at all.
6986,Yeah. <BR> My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
6987,No wait a minute -- there's someone else. <BR> Who? <BR> Tom... He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw.
6988,We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew... <BR> There's no one left ... <BR> We've got several Italian cars on the list. Always tricky always timeconsuming. So we're gonna need a specialist ...
6989,Aren't you coming? <BR> I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
6990,Mr. Lundegaard? <BR> Huh? Yah? <BR> I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here - <BR> What... What is it all about? <BR> Huh? Do you mind if I sit down - I'm carrying quite a load here.
6991,Casandra. Old girlfriend? <BR> Something like that. <BR> Did she break your heart? <BR> Something like that. <BR> It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago? <BR> You ask a lot of questions. <BR> That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it? <BR> I don't remember.    I was drunk. <BR> You got it in a bar? <BR> No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy? <BR> Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry. <BR> It's okay.   It was a long time ago. <BR> I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know a flower or something. On my ass.
6992,Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something? <BR> 'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know it's stimulating.
6993,With the whole world crumbling we pick this time to fall in love. <BR> Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you say ten years ago? <BR> Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you? <BR> Looking for a job.
6994,I just found a picture of you. <BR> How do I look? <BR> Like shit.
6995,You're still here? <BR> I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.
6996,Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies. <BR> Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties. <BR> Okay There's more Stan --
6997,What? Did she say something? <BR> She wants you to paint the ashtray. <BR> I'm not painting the fu -- I'm not painting the ashtray. And frogs aren't purple.
6998,Okay... but just...just to see. <BR> Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive. <BR> Okay. <BR> Come on... let's find you something to wear.
6999,Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future? <BR> No. <BR> You ever going to bed? <BR> No. <BR> Well I ain't sleepy either. <BR> Good. Then have a drink. <BR> No. Not me boss. <BR> Then don't have a drink. <BR> Boss let's get out of here. <BR> No sir. I'm waiting for a lady. <BR> Please boss let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here. <BR> She's coming back. I know she's coming back. <BR> We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone. <BR> Shut up and go home will you? <BR> No sir. I'm staying right here.
7000,Dude anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways. <BR> Yeah...
7001,Whatareyoudoing?! <BR> What if he doesn't like me? <BR> It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable. <BR> My God... you're right. <BR> Faith I'm kidding.  Is this how you plan to get what you want from life?  When you finally find it you turn and run away from it?
7002,They won't... <BR> They will!  You tell them if they don't come now I will shoot you!
7003,What's it for!? <BR> Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away deliveries whatever. <BR> Is it gassed up? <BR> Fully. <BR> Four door? <BR> Two. <BR> Open? <BR> Covered. <BR> How many? <BR> Holds four. <BR> Max? <BR> Seven. <BR> Nine? <BR> Seven. <BR> Keys. <BR> What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck! <BR> Let me make this clear; if we stay we die! <BR> I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
7004,That's good. Now what's her name? <BR> Katherine. <BR> Katherine?... Katherine who? <BR> She's my daughter.
7005,What are you doing here?  You're not cleared for this area! <BR> You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost. <BR> I'll report you.  It's.... <BR> Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me.  We're going.... <BR> Get out of here Leave me alone.
7006,Wow a lot of people showed up. <BR> Yeah so what do we say? <BR> I thought you had something planned. <BR> Me?!
7007,What are you doing here dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four. <BR> I couldn't do it Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines with like spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls and Su-Chin Kuah was there and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails! <BR> Oh gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out? <BR> I'm staying pregnant Le. <BR> Keep your voice down dude my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active. <BR> What does that even mean? Anyway I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos. <BR> But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant. <BR> I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless. <BR> Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break. <BR> Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.
7008,You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon? <BR> Pleading with a crazy man with come all over my face.
7009,You must've had a reason to ask me that. <BR> No. I'm just a snoop. <BR> You seem to have had a reason for every other question. <BR> No not for that one. <BR> I don't believe you.
7010,I don't see the point in that. <BR> Because that's no good. Remember we did what we did we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it if you can't have it what use is it? None. It's nothing all for nothing if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing so that I could have nothing --
7011,The building superintendent and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station. <BR>  <BR> The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country. <BR> A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately? <BR> Jeff -- huh? <BR> Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train? <BR> I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone including you actually see her murdered? <BR> Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case or making me look foolish? <BR> If possible -- both. <BR> Well then do a good job of it! Get over there and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence. <BR> I can't do that. <BR> I mean when he goes out for a paper or a drink or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him. <BR> I can't do it even if he's gone. <BR> What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department? <BR> Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes! <BR> Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear. <BR>  <BR> Give him evidence. <BR>  <BR> By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment. <BR> A detective's nightmare. <BR> What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door? <BR> One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer! <BR> How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years? <BR> You know every day for three years I asked myself that same question? <BR> Ever get an answer? <BR> 
7012,No I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn. <BR> A 'Finn?' What is a Finn? <BR> You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years living with a pompous asshole. Then she sees her opportunity and BOOM! -- she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. These heartlanders can't figure it out 'cause that's not their sweet little Betty. Hah! We've been tracking her for what three days and I already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg.
7013,We can be happy.  We really can.  We love you Dick.  The girls and I... <BR> If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce?
7014,One hundred and twenty feet. <BR> What? <BR> Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet? <BR> No way man you'd rob me blind!
7015,"What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up? <BR> We think we know where Betty is. <BR> Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?"
7016,Not anymore Mr. O'Brien.  The nanobot has changed that. <BR> If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this you are deluding yourself. <BR> You don't have to give it to us because Dr. Nebbleman can just cut it out of him.
7017,Yes they're here.  Oh - white orchids.  Would you believe it - I haven't had white orchids since I was a debutante.  What's this? <BR> What's what?  Oh that.  just a little going away present. <BR> Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous? <BR> Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me. <BR> I didn't do anything.  It just happened.
7018,That's *it*? <BR> That's it. <BR> It means nothin' at all! And all this time I been *wonderin'* about it!
7019,Just tell me where it hurts baby. <BR> What? <BR> I want to play this one close Bob. Like it was with that girl what's her name with the black hair. That felt good. Whaddya think?
7020,When did you think it would happen? <BR> I'm not sure. <BR> I knew when I first met you. <BR> Oh.
7021,You ok? <BR> FINE. Are you? <BR> Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what? <BR> What? <BR> Mark invited me to the party. <BR> What party? <BR> Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard? <BR> No.
7022,And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son. <BR> I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help. <BR> Well now Jeffrey how did you come to get so involved? <BR> I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more. <BR> Is Sandy part of this? <BR> No. not at all. <BR> Who knows you have these? <BR> Only you. and the photo lab. <BR> You're all through with this now?
7023,There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides it'll be safer where it is. <BR> With all due respect skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
7024,How about Canada? <BR> What are we going to do take a taxi?
7025,Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did. <BR> Jah...
7026,We're all manipulated. From the moment we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before I was even born. <BR> Really? <BR> Yes. We have no real freedom. You of all people should understand that. This may sting.
7027,Look it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not. <BR> OK I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
7028,Problems? <BR> Is my money in there? <BR> Uh-huh. You couldve waited for me inside.
7029,Why didn't you tell me the truth about him? <BR> We weren't sure we could trust you.
7030,What can I do for you? <BR> Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams. <BR> Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
7031,It's okay it's okay.... <BR> Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me Sean.
7032,Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house? <BR> I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
7033,Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it? <BR> Well that's why they paid so well. <BR> You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace what do we got on for next week? <BR> Well it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right? <BR> Okay. You come by the house? <BR> I'll come by. <BR> Seven o'clock? <BR> Seven o'clock.
7034,I figger best we leave something like this on him lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt.  Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one. <BR> Not be so lonesome either knowin' his name is there with 'im not just' a old fella lonesome underground. <BR> Casy won't you say a few words?
7035,Hey - these are real diamonds. <BR> Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back. <BR> Wait a minute - lets not be hasty. After all we don't want to hurt poor Osgood's feelings.
7036,Nix Flo -- he won't let you in and you'll only get me in Dutch. <BR> Horsefeathers!
7037,I need your car Elizabeth. <BR> What happened to you Nick?  I mean look at yourself... <BR> I know look at me well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while. <BR> Of course you can have it if you need it.  Can I get you something to eat?
7038,Then who *do* we shoot? <BR> Brother I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame! <BR> Well I'm right here to tell you mister ain't *nobody* going to push me off *my* land! Grampa took up this land seventy years ago. My pa was born here. We was *all* born on it and some of us got killed on it and some died on it. And that's what makes it ourn--bein' born on it and workin' it and dyin' on it--and not no piece of paper with writin' on it! So just come on and try to push me off!
7039,J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar <BR> What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30. <BR> You're going to miss your train!  Lou meet me at 1412 Adelaide.

They're expensive but you can afford it. <BR> What the hell is this all about?
7040,If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds you know that. <BR> Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause? <BR> Well look who's here.

7060,...Mr. Lundegaard? <BR> ...Brainerd? <BR> Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox. <BR> ...Babe the Blue Ox? <BR> Yah ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing then? <BR> No. No ma'am. <BR> Okey-dokey thanks a bunch. I'll let you get back to your paperwork then.
7061,I'm not very happy with you right now Grady. But more importantly Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is would you Grady? <BR> Inside. <BR> And the jacket? <BR> Over there. In the backseat of the...
7062,Casper! Was up kid? <BR> Nothen' B. <BR> Where you at? <BR> Right here. <BR> Where you goin' tonight? <BR> Maybe Nasa. I don't know. <BR> You goin'? <BR> Yeah. <BR> I'm goin'. You on the list? <BR> Probably. Fuck that I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight. <BR> I had a female vagina last night.
7063,Can you imagine if Dickie did kill Freddie what must that be like? To wake up every morning how can you? Just wake up and be a person drink a coffee...? <BR> Whatever you do however terrible however hurtful -- it all makes sense doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel. <BR> But you're still tormented you must be you've killed somebody... <BR> Don't you put the past in a room in the cellar and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do. <BR> Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building. <BR> Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key say open up step inside but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
7064,Frederico! <BR> Ciao bello.  Don't you want to fuck every woman you see. Just once.
7065,Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks. <BR> Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
7066,That's it...?  Come on guys... life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken' or you mean it.  Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say you haven't got the best of records. <BR> ...things change. <BR> ...that's true. Sometimes they change sometimes they don't. Now I remember back to when you were disbarred... <BR> I wasn't disbarred they dropped the pro... <BR> And it seems to me a fella's trying to come back he'd take this settlement and get a record for himself.  I myself would take it and run like a thief. <BR> I'm sure you would.
7067,Jackie I'm William Starks. I can prove it. <BR> What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license? <BR> No I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital. <BR> Well you belong in one.
7068,Anything today? <BR> Oh it's you!  You got a lot of nerve - <BR> Thank you.
7069,Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work. <BR> It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
7070,I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for but I need you Corky. <BR> For what? <BR> You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again? <BR> What choice? <BR> If those quarters fell to the floor would you still reach up to that cash register?
7071,See? Did you see that? <BR> She smiles at everyone Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas.
7072,The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special counsel. <BR> Thanks Harry.  Know anything about Colson? <BR> 
7073,Everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father.  Because of you. <BR> Well that's just typical isn't it? <BR> Is it true Phil? <BR> I gotta go. <BR> You weren't there you don't know what happened. <BR> I know enough.
7074,You're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life... that's including any place... the worst... Europe United... any place... Asia. <BR> Yeah. <BR> And I love what you're wearin'.
7075,...what am I <u>doing</u>?  Do you see me working...?  Here's what you want to do you want to come out of the box an item someone 'ready <u>has</u> but <u>then</u> you sell it to'em.  Torn <u>jeans</u> uh ... faded Levi Jackets uh... uh... <BR> Where are we on the Image?  Grace?  <u>Grace</u>...
7076,Do you think guys find that attractive? <BR> Oh give me a break Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
7077,Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too Esperanza. We're going to win this strike. <BR> What makes you so sure? <BR> Because if we lose we lose more than a strike. We lose the union. And the men know this. And if we win we win more than a few demands. We win...  ... something bigger. Hope. Hope for our kids. Juanito can't grow strong on milk alone.
7078,"There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign when you came in. Anyway, they're supposed to tell you. <BR> Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem. <BR> What do you want? <BR> What are my choices? <BR> Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol. <BR> No alcohol? <BR> No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want? <BR> What do you think I should get? <BR> Non-alcoholic malt beverage? <BR> ...Noooo. <BR> Orange soda? <BR> No. <BR> Coffee? <BR> No. <BR> Sparkling apple cider? <BR> No. <BR> Water? <BR> Water? <BR> One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you. <BR> Water."
7079,I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind. <BR> Shut up donut.
7080,Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron. <BR> He tried to rob me -- he is dead -- <BR> My best friend -- poor Baron -- dead -- just like that. <BR> -- We must do something... <BR> Yes the police must be called. <BR> No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money. <BR> Oh no -- no -- not the Baron. <BR> Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room. <BR> Her room -- oh -- I see Mr. Preysing -- I understand Mr. General Director Preysing. <BR> I can answer for this it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters you know them? <BR> Yes I know them -- <BR> The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you. <BR> We must call the police your excellency.
7081,Why not? <BR> I could give you a dozen good reasons. <BR> Shut up. <BR> Okay okay don't say I didn't remind you.
7082,I thought you stopped going. <BR> Yeah he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
7083,Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break. <BR> I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
7084,Where did you get this material? <BR> The apple core club. <BR> The apple core? <BR> No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us. <BR> How do they do that? <BR> Give us things. Not just some old flag like this but - <BR> But what?
7085,Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see when Jimmy was twelve years old his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain. <BR> I don't see the connection. <BR> The connection is it did a head number on him. He's petrified of cars. Won't drive. I've known him all my life and he's never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle. He rides passenger and he rides horses and that's it. The man that shot Leo down was behind the wheel of a moving car.
7086,You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy? <BR> No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
7087,What're you doing here?! <BR> We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night.
7088,Shall I tell them again? <BR> Why waste time -- it's getting late. <BR> You see -- what we are interested in -- <BR> Ah come on -- we're going home.
7089,Do you think she will give us the designs? <BR> Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage. <BR> And you think O'Brien is that leverage? <BR> That remains to be seen.
7090,So. Is he any good? <BR> No. Not yet he isn't. <BR> Well I'm going to read it anyway. <BR> Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's -- <BR> He is. Take my word for it. <BR> I think it's more complicated than that. Besides he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least I think so. Anyway he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now. <BR> On the contrary it could be just the ticket.
7091,The good part was I had Amy back. So we went home had the housekeeper stay over put the kid to bed I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil you know.  But... hey twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense. <BR> First of all he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I um I mean how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast and I pay twice as much. <BR> I bought him a watch too. <BR> Yeah. <BR> Yeah. <BR> But even if you bought him a watch a really nice watch one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so you go five ten twelve grand? <BR> Yeah. <BR> At the most which is impossible for him.
7092,Lucky thing my running into you. Just the man I need. <BR> You're not making any mistake believe you me. <BR> I can use a smart guy like you. <BR> Say listen when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley you're talking to <BR> Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly. <BR> Huh? <BR> A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you? <BR> Whyno <BR> That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them.
7093,He said to go fuck yourself. <BR> We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass.
7094,That guy I brought in yesterday post-cardiac arrest. He's gone. <BR> Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics steroids nitrodrips heparin. <BR> What do you think? <BR> Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints. <BR> The family know? <BR> I wanted to bring them in to see if he'd respond to voices but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her she's gone.
7095,I told her she was going to meet her father. <BR> You what? <BR> It was the only way Auggie. Otherwise she wasn't going to let me see her. <BR> I think you'd better stop the car and let me out. <BR> Relax okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides you might even learn something. <BR> Yeah like what? <BR> That I wasn't bullshitting you sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth. <BR> Look I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter. <BR> Wait till you see her Auggie. <BR> And what's that supposed to mean? <BR> She looks just like you. <BR> Cut it out. Just cut it out okay? It's starting to get on my nerves. <BR> When I told her I was going to bring her father she kind of melted. It's the first time Felicity's talked nice to me since she left home. She's dying to meet you Auggie.
7096,You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here. <BR> Believe me I know.
7097,They stop for nothing. <BR> But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  -- <BR> Nothing.
7098,Ted! Do something! <BR> What do you want me to do? <BR> This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom! <BR> Hang in there I'll think of something.
7099,I appreciate your concern but she has to rest so you can go on home. <BR> Oh sure.
7100,Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number? <BR> No -- I'm afraid not. <BR> Well how do I know who you are? <BR> You don't.
7101,So. Is it different to how you imagined it? <BR> Yes. <BR> I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined? <BR> Yes.
7102,Mr. Gittes sorry to keep you waiting. These staff meetings they just go on and on. <BR> Yeah must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances. <BR> Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness what happened to your nose? <BR> I cut myself shaving. <BR> You ought to be more careful. That must really smart. <BR> Only when I breathe. <BR> Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray? <BR> I never was. <BR> I don't understand. <BR> Neither do I actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me. <BR> Mr. Gittes you're not making a bit of sense. <BR> Well look at it this way Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned. <BR> Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about. <BR> Well Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news.
7103,CARTMAN! <BR> WAGAGAHGHGH!! YOU GUYS!!! SERIOUSLY!!!
7104,Ah ha!... <BR> What'd you find? <BR> A Butterfinger wrapper. <BR> A rich possibly fat slob. <BR> Maybe there's fingerprints on it? <BR> We're not looking to arrest the man Faith we're trying to locate him. <BR> Oh.  Right.
7105,He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about? <BR> Well I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried. <BR> He gives a fuck what I do? <BR> Look I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him. <BR> Okay. <BR> All right? <BR> Yeah.  Thanks.
7106,Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay? <BR> It will be okay. <BR> *What* will be okay? <BR> We have to wait and see. I think that for *everything* in life you have to wait and see.
7107,Nothing I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's. <BR> Okay. <BR> Fine.
7108,Here's this nice hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. I mean who rides the bus anymore? <BR> People without cars.
7109,You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife. <BR> You fucking bastard!
7110,That's not bad at all. <BR>  <BR> Napoleon said fellow won't sell you his life but he will trade it to you for a little piece of ribbon.
7111,I've been meaning to come in a long time. <BR> You live in the neighborhood? <BR> Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months so I stopped by. <BR> How old is he? <BR> Four. You're great with these kids.
7112,You broke my heart. <BR> What are we looking for? <BR> A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that? <BR> Can we turn the light on? <BR> That's not the way it's done.
7113,Yes what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around. <BR> I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north. <BR> Well hurry before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice? <BR> Thanks.
7114,Jesus Kip ... I'm shot man ... <BR> Just hold on... Hold on ...
7115,Daddy did ya see that? <BR> What? <BR> Guy got me on the ground tried to fuck me.
7116,I can use Johnnie's car dump it in Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ... <BR> Just hurry.
7117,So what? The thing with the glass? Price did that? <BR> I hope not.
7118,When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay can you? <BR> No I can't.
7119,The CPU from the first terminator. <BR> Son of a bitch I knew it!
7120,Thanks guys. <BR> I hope you feel better sweetie. <BR> Yeah. <BR> Say hi to Naomi.
7121,John Saxon.  Do you have any idea what time it is? <BR> John.  It's Heather.  I need help! <BR> You got it.  What's happening? <BR> Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy! <BR> You're right.  That sounds crazy! <BR> John.  Will you please just look for him around the hospital?  I'm gonna go right to the house.  Will you help me John?  Please!
7122,Hear that?  Talk to me where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about. <BR> Go fuck yourself.
7123,Have you done this sort of thing before? <BR> Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast. <BR> Looting and pillaging eh? <BR> Yes. <BR> What about the raping? <BR> Shut up. <BR> It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life. <BR> Sh!
7124,For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me. <BR> Well most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds? <BR> Why not tell me now?
7125,When I married Ginger I knew all the stories but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein' I said. 'I can change her.' <BR> It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -
7126,Friends of yours huh? <BR> The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here. <BR> What's their program? <BR> They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it the spiritual side of it. <BR> You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you? <BR> No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world. <BR> Thanks for stepping in. <BR> De nada.
7127, <BR> However it goes the point is nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
7128,"Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel. <BR> And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel. <BR> Will you lighten up, please? <BR> One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me."
7129,No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics no cologne seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document but we will not interact. <BR> That's a scientific impossibility you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study you also change.
7130,What about our friend - Sark? <BR> Probably decided not to pursue us The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here. <BR> Not us I hope. <BR> Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs.
7131,There's nothing we can do. She had the key. <BR> She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
7132,THE PAIN! <BR> NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it young human.... Do it!
7133,No pain Mr. Kringelein? <BR> Pain? Oh no Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it...
7134,What for? <BR> Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
7135,Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess. <BR> And Larry?... <BR> What about Larry? <BR> I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
7136,Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you. <BR> I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses and driving a station wagon.
7137,If there really is someone else in this house I think the four of us can handle the situation. <BR> I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!
7138,Take a bow Steven you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me. <BR> If that's the fact Price okay you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
7139,It's... behind... us. <BR> It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
7140,Easy on that! <BR> Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up... <BR> They're with 'em -- if they're still alive.
7141,I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me. <BR> Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit he'll probably call out the National Guard. <BR> I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in. <BR> Look we handle it ourselves for right now okay?  We cover the bank whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens or more accurately when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
7142,Well! A precedent is being broken. Er Emil! <BR> This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
7143, <BR> Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf. <BR> What?  Hey listen what-what do you think? Do you think we should uh go to that-that party in Southampton tonight?
7144,I'm Ted by the way. I think I forgot to say that. <BR> I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April. <BR> The one with the horses. <BR> That's me. <BR> I almost didn't recognize you without...you know...that stallion between...your...uh...legs.
7145,What is that? <BR> Photo database. I'll do your photos now.
7146,It's magic. <BR>  <BR> I've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight.
7147,Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong? <BR> What if we fall?  I hate trees.
7148,You guys have any skills at all? <BR> Hell yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels and some things without; Toby's a hacker can do things with a computer that are pretty amazing ...
7149,Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from. <BR> From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
7150,Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour? <BR> I couldn't go to sleep Mom. I had to tell you! <BR> Tell me what? <BR> I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and gee Mom where do you think he went? Right into the space ship! <BR> Now Bobby just a minute-- <BR> Honest Mom I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around! <BR> Bobby you've been dreaming again. <BR> No I haven't Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
7151,Yeah that's right.  You wanna come in and shake it for me? <BR> If you're gonna cheat you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right. <BR> You've gotta be kidding.  Get the fuck outta my way!
7152,What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?! <BR> Well let's see... First of all you fuck pigs. <BR> Oh yeah!
7153,Thank you for the guided tour but would you mind telling me what were doing here? <BR> How come youre alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise? <BR> Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself Emily or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight problem...
7154,This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power. <BR> Narcissus will never support you Caesar he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
7155,Ugh... You guys seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal... <BR> Mkay kids from all over the State have been brought here because you all share the same problem. Uh young man... Let's start with you.
7156,Comical part of it is it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is you're just running away.  From yourself mostly. 'Cause you're miserable.

You've worked wonders with Margo...

7191,Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound? <BR> Sure. <BR> Do you like pink? <BR> Very much. <BR> Where do you hail from? <BR> Well I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
7192,They killed our friend. It's personal now. Besides if we do that then Julien died for nothing. The tapes are the key. <BR> He's right. The tapes give us leverage with Bastaldi.

But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live The Knight can never have it all. <BR> But we cannot be killed. <BR> There is an imperfection.  For all your healing if your head ever leaves your neck you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end. <BR> How can I stop such a man? <BR> Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help. <BR> Why? <BR> We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.

7207,Well that's not entirely true Barnett. At least not according to Haven. <BR> Haven? Hell' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen. <BR> I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out. <BR> He knows better. <BR> Well it's probably because it would help him. <BR> How is that? <BR> Everybody likes to be as good as their word. <BR> Whose word? <BR> His Word. <BR> His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something? <BR> That's pretty close. He's going to be on the bill. Why not put Barbara Jean on with him?

7210,"Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down. <BR> You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win."
7211,Naturally I want the best for him money is no object. <BR> Perhaps if we could meet your father. <BR> There's just one question. <BR> Of course. <BR> Do you accept anyone of the Jewish persuasion?

7214,I can't let you take her out. <BR> You can't stop me.
7215,Your Aunt called me. <BR> I was afraid of that. <BR> She wants to know who's staying in her apartment. <BR> It's just for a night or two until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ... <BR> Sweetie look at me straight.

But I thought she died. <BR> He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff. <BR> You mean -- she didn't like sex? <BR> I bet mom could've helped her. <BR> Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk? <BR> Not yet. You want to go? <BR> I think I better. Between the book and the coffee I'm this close to raping the busboy.
7218,Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready. <BR> All right.
7219,I saw my grandmother of course but I don't suppose that counts. I mean she was alive at the time. <BR> Can I show you something?

7221,The young girl clutching her bloody chest...drags herself crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again. <BR>  <BR> The young girl is slashed again. <BR> The knife slices into Maureen again...then again. The theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A horrifying sickening sight.
7222,And as you do the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor. <BR> An accident. <BR> Shit!  Oh shit!
7223,What? <BR> You... <BR> I got what I paid for. <BR> You didn't mind too much.

7226,We're getting a stretch limo. <BR> Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me. <BR> You're mad. Why are you mad? <BR> I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday... <BR> Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye. She just looks like that all the time.
7227,You get quick action don't you? <BR> Margo I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you... <BR> You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her Max. <BR> But what could she do? <BR> She'd be a great help - read scripts interview people you have to see get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure- <BR> Well... <BR> Think of your health Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track... <BR> I don't know if this would be a wise move... <BR> Promise. <BR> I promise. <BR> That's my Max.
7228,Youre out of your mind. Whats the idea? <BR> Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on lets go...
7229,I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth. <BR> I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me and I abandoned my instincts.  Never abandon you instincts. <BR> I didn't. You gave me a look! <BR> What 'look'? <BR> That one look you got! I thought you were done so I took him out... <BR> I wasn't done I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out you scalped him. Christ I almost puked did I tell you that? <BR> Well why'd you have to tell that Indian story? <BR> What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
7230,Come on Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop. <BR> As long as ya got one top Boss somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war. <BR> Who'll make the rules? <BR> We'll make 'em and we'll enforce 'em. All of us. Together. We all get one vote. Includin' me. <BR> Charlie I'm from the old country and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses? <BR> 
7231,You must help us. <BR> We don't HAVE to help anybody. <BR> Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time. <BR> Why should WE care? <BR> Because... you're... you're the Gods.... <BR> So? <BR> Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.
7232,Oh really?  I'm from Playskool. <BR> And I'm from Mattel.  Well I'm not actually  from Mattel I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well I don't really understand the financials but...

Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers. <BR> Yeahwouldn't it? <BR> It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame you know what I'd do? <BR> What? <BR> I'd go fifty-fifty with you . <BR> Why? <BR> Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it see?  A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball[10] is what I always say. <BR> What's on your mind? <BR> Five G'sor I crab the works. <BR> You're a pretty shrewd baby.  We better get away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately.
7234,"Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before. <BR> Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him.

But hey if you think there's a market for it. <BR> God I love being dead.

7262,Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus? <BR> Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way I gave her a name: Clara.
7263,"We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south. <BR> How many, would you say? <BR> Enough to go around...I'd say about a dozen apiece...Mount 'em up!"
7264,Hey I was thinking for the dance what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know and a picture of the earth. <BR> Don't tread on the earth?
7265,Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual? <BR> Hopefully though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.
7266,What? What happened? <BR> I think... something stung me.
7267,Celebrate? What for? <BR> It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago and I think I should celebrate having made it this far. <BR> Hey hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me? <BR> I just did. <BR> I mean earlier. We could have planned something.
7268,She seemed to take it pretty well. <BR> Yeah well actually...
7269,Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath. <BR> Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private? <BR> Certainly sir. <BR> Well now that's very kind -- thanks. That's what I want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- Yes that's what I want. I can pay now if you like.
7270,You're just going to lock the store like that? <BR> I want to talk to you about something and I don't want to be disturbed. <BR> You saw it? <BR> Very dramatic I thought. <BR> It's not what you think. <BR> What it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child? <BR> I'm not pregnant. <BR> Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation? <BR> I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well I didn't want to mess it up. <BR> You could've broke it to me gently you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend. <BR> I know I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month... <BR> And you said yes? <BR> Well... kind of sort of? <BR> Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is? <BR> I would've told you and you would have stopped calling like a baby. <BR> How do you know that? <BR> Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones. <BR> So you're really getting married? <BR> No. <BR> No you're not really getting married? <BR> The story goes like this: He proposed and I told him I had to think about it and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged. <BR> How like her. <BR> Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here because I knew you'd be a wreck. <BR> Thanks for the vote of confidence. <BR> Was I right? <BR> Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even. <BR> I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish? <BR> And you came here to what? To comfort me? <BR> The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you. <BR> But you were. <BR> No I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people. <BR> Yeah but not seriously. Christ you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody. <BR> I'm giving him his ring back. <BR> What? <BR> I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm and he's going to be pulling a huge salary which would give me no reason to work and he's so traditional anyway... <BR> Sang? His name is a past tense? <BR> Stop it. He's a nice guy. <BR> If he's so nice why aren't you going to marry him? <BR> I just told you. <BR> There's more isn't there? <BR> Why Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean? <BR> Tell me I don't have something to do with it. <BR> You don't have anything to do with it. <BR> You lie. <BR> Look how full of yourself you are. <BR> I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed. <BR> If I'm so nuts about you then why am I having sex with an Asian design major? <BR> Jesus you're caustic. <BR> I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years. <BR> So who's asking? I don't want to marry you. <BR> Good. Stay in that frame of mind. <BR> But can we date? <BR> I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that. <BR> We could introduce them. They might hit it off. <BR> You're serious. You want to date again. <BR> I would like to be your boyfriend yes. <BR> It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me you'll get over it. <BR> Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together you know. I'm more mature you're more mature you're finishing college I'm already in the job market... <BR> You work in a market all right. <BR> Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing. <BR> The key word here is talk Dante. I think the idea the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date. <BR> So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating? <BR> I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens. <BR> Let me take you out tonight. <BR> You mean on a date? <BR> Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie. <BR> The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before. <BR> You have a better suggestion? <BR> How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date? <BR> I hear that's a rather popular date. <BR> Jerk. Here I am throwing myself at you succumbing to your wily charms and you call me a slut in so many words. <BR> What about Sing? <BR> Sang. <BR> Sang. <BR> He's not invited. <BR> He's your fiancé. <BR> I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend Dante and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose I choose you. <BR> So what are you saying? <BR> You're such an asshole. <BR> I'm just kidding. <BR> I can already tell this isn't going to work. <BR> I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back. <BR> Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side like an obedient lapdog. <BR> He went to rent a movie but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note. <BR> You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother which is going to cause quite a row considering she loves Sang. <BR> Who doesn't? <BR> Well me I guess.  So I shall take my leave of you but I will return in a little while at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you. <BR> What happened to the walk and the nakedness? <BR> I'm easy but I'm not that easy.  See you later handsome.
7271,Boy oh boy you're a mess. <BR> Yeah. <BR> So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown... <BR> Bothers everybody who works there but to me... It was...
7272,I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things. <BR> I was only reacting to what I was told.
7273,Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud! <BR> I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko. <BR> I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life. <BR> What the hell's that supposed to mean?
7274,What's this? <BR> Why don't you open it and find out? <BR> Jesus God Auggie. There's money in here. <BR> Five thousand bucks. <BR> And you're giving it to me? <BR> It's all yours baby. <BR> For keeps? <BR> For keeps. <BR> I can't believe it. Oh God I can't believe it.  You're an angel Auggie. An angel from heaven.
7275,Okay sweetie night night sleep tight. <BR> Don't let the bedbugs bite.
7276,Listen Hank I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that. <BR> Why did you come here Grady?
7277,"Your color. <BR> I think you should wear one at a time. One of these... and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but I didn't think it would fly... as a gift, I mean."
7278,"But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours. <BR> And what about you?"
7279,"You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue? <BR> The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it. <BR> And you've never seen anything like that? <BR> No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --"
7280,This is the Space Cowboy.  I'm an intergalactic traveler from the Federation planet earth. <BR> Gordo? <BR> How'd you know my name mister?
7281,My father has a gun at home. <BR> No. <BR> Sandy. this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
7282,I owe you a very serious apology young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not. <BR> VERY ACCOMMODATING Well no sir I'm sure ...
7283,Thanks again.  I 'm glad you waited. <BR> I couldn't have... much longer. <BR> Yeah... I know. <BR> But I got you out. Didn't I Doc. I did it. I got you out.
7284,See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it. <BR> Got it.
7285,Homer don't you know what business you in? You don't wanna go into no business with me Homer--ain't that right? <BR> Go on cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.
7286,You heard the news. <BR> I hear Twombley got shot. <BR> Yeah.
7287,I know... <BR> We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all
7288,Hey I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword. <BR> Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out? <BR> You can believe what you want.  You saw the tape.
7289,I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me? <BR> Frances? <BR> My fiancée.
7290,Anything else? <BR> A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range... <BR> Just what you see pal.
7291,Oh my god. <BR> Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning. <BR> How? When? <BR> Embolism in her brain. Yesterday. <BR> Jesus. <BR> She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke. <BR> I haven't seen her in almost two years. <BR> Correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve? <BR> Number six. <BR> You've had sex with a dead person. <BR> I'm gonna go to her wake. <BR> No you're not. <BR> Why not? <BR> It's today. <BR> What!? <BR> Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four. <BR> Shit. What about tomorrow? <BR> One night only. She's buried in the morning. <BR> You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this. <BR> Wait wait wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well? <BR> You hardly knew her! <BR> True but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates to say the least. <BR> Stop it. This is beneath even you. <BR> I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season. <BR> You hate people. <BR> But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic? <BR> Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store. <BR> If you go I go. <BR> She meant nothing to you! <BR> She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died. <BR> I'm not taking you to this funeral. <BR> I'm going with you. <BR> I can't close the store. <BR> You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof! <BR> Exactly which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake.
7292,'Roy'. <BR> Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know don't be shy okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand? <BR> They're all yours Al.  Good luck.
7293,Go on tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once. <BR> It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.
7294,Split it up. Any word on Donny? <BR> He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit. <BR> What happened to Sway? <BR> She left...
7295,Caesar's Mafia isn't he? <BR> You have to ask? <BR> No. <BR>  <BR> How did you meet him? <BR> They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it. <BR> He's a launderer? <BR> Basically. <BR> How long have you been with him? <BR> Almost five years. <BR> Five years is a long time. <BR> Yes it is.
7296,I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway. <BR> And why is that? <BR> Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
7297,The most wonderful thing happened - <BR> What? <BR> Guess! <BR> They repealed Prohibition?
7298,Inside they were talking of you. <BR> I can just imagine. <BR> No. They envy you. <BR> For being a bootlegger? <BR> For being a man.
7299,What's she so emotional about? <BR> I don't know. She got left here like the rest of us didn't she?
7300,Oh -- careful Mr. Preysing. <BR> Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name? <BR> Oh no. <BR> Why not? <BR> I couldn't do that you're a stranger to me. <BR> You're a funny little creature Flaemmchen. I can't make you out. <BR> It's not funny at all. One can't get intimate just off hand. I could go to England with you and everything like that -- supposing I met you next year and I said: 'How do you do Mr. Preysing! And you said:  'That was the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester'.
7301,Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now! <BR> Time is of no importance Mr. President. Only life is important. <BR> That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.
7302,Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford Bill Mike John and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks. <BR> I'm not staying out here.
7303,Are you alright? <BR> Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?
7304,It has to be like a socially conscious theme. <BR> 'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'
7305,Well I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey  Let me know when you're quitting. <BR> I'm not quitting! <BR> No? <BR> No! <BR> 'For he's only a bird in a gilded cage a beautiful sight to see'  Tweet tweet - ha ha
7306,I don't know... <BR> What about that other guy? <BR> Other guy? <BR> Yeah. Ken said there was another guy there... _big_ guy... then he dropped the phone. What's going on?
7307,It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is quite simply just that. <BR> Did you ever kill a man?
7308,Yo you think we killed that guy? <BR> Na. <BR> You sure? <BR> I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken. <BR> Yo we might have killed him. You think?
7309,"And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up... <BR> Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new. <BR> They're new to us..."
7310,Were those flowers really for me Brad? <BR> Of course. <BR> How much did they cost? <BR> Don't worry about it.
7311,Mrs. Mulwray do you love your husband? <BR> ...Yes of course. <BR> Then go home and forget about it. <BR> But... <BR> I'm sure he loves you too. You know the expression let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing. <BR> But I have to know.
7312,I couldn't turn you in not now. I....I know I wouldn't! <BR> You don't know.  You don't.... <BR> If I take something you suffer. If I don't I stuff.... <BR> I know you can do it without sedation You can I know you can. <BR> Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't. <BR> We could leave and live in the superstructure....
7313,How did you escape? <BR> I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live.  Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.
7314,Look look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean look what the hell she's doing. <BR> Speeding?
7315,They lied. <BR> 'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is? <BR> I do. Yes. <BR> You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago. <BR> That's not my handwriting. <BR> You've just said you signed it. <BR> Yes I yes I signed it yes. But I I didn't write that figure. <BR> You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years? <BR> Because I kept a copy. I have it right here.
7316,Do I know you? <BR> No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
7317,What are we supposed to talk about? <BR> You've gotta be kidding? <BR> But they don't speak English. <BR> There are some things that everybody does in the same language.
7318,Well you certainly had a good look around. <BR> You were magnificent.
7319,Can't you use something else? <BR> I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time. <BR> Do what you need to do. Just do it fast. <BR> Right.
7320,Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me? <BR> Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom? <BR> I didn't turn her into Mother. You did. <BR> This person and I are a thing of the total past. I promise you.
7321,You shouldn't smoke. <BR> It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey. <BR> That's my brother's problem. He's passed out inside.
7322,It's just that I have no experience and no men to speak of. How can I-- <BR> Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
7323,Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it. <BR> I was afraid that might happen. <BR> Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives. <BR> There's only one alternative to the serum.
7324,Club's expanding its roster to finish the season-- <BR> Shut up.  I'm playing.  Oh you won't regret it young girls don't forget it lost in their own wilderness ...  But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness...

7330,Okay let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor works as a legal-- <BR> That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
7331,Yes...what is it? <BR> I'm sorry Mr. Kesher but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card. <BR> ... What?? <BR> The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us. <BR> How...  how'd they know I was here? <BR> I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files. <BR> So what did they say? <BR> Well Sir I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled. <BR> Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night okay? <BR> That's fine Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you. <BR> Fine. I'll check out in the morning. <BR> Have a good evening Mr. Kesher.

The chart said she ate nine hours prior to... <BR> ...she went in complaining of stomach cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart. <BR> Is that what a good doctor would do?

Needles thread sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything.  <BR> A man should have a hobby. <BR> It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time not fill it. <BR> Is your time so empty? <BR> Oh no!  I run the office tend the cabins and grounds do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing. <BR> You go out... with friends? <BR> Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you? <BR> Only my share. <BR> Where are you going? I don't mean to pry... <BR> I'm looking for a private island. <BR> What are you running away from? <BR> Why do you ask that? <BR> No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps clamped in them and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air only at each other and for all of it we never budge an inch. <BR> Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps. <BR> I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore. <BR> You should... mind it. <BR> Oh I do... but I say I don't.  <BR> If anyone ever spoke to me the way I heard... The way she spoke to you I don't think I could ever laugh again. <BR> Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill. <BR> She sounded strong... <BR> I mean... ill.  She had to raise me all by herself after my dad died... I was only five... and it must have been a strain. Oh she didn't have to go out to work or anything Dad left us with a little something... anyway a few years ago... Mother met a man. He talked her into building this motel... We could have talked her into anything... and when.  Well... It was just too much for her when he died too... And the way he died... Oh it's nothing to talk about when you're eating.  Anyway it was too much of a loss for my mother... she had nothing left. <BR> Except you. <BR> A son is a poor substitute for a lover.  <BR> Why don't you go away? <BR> To a private island like you? <BR> No not like me. <BR> It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there the fire would go out... damp and cold like a grave. When you love someone you don't do that to them even if you hate them. Oh I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness. <BR> Wouldn't it be better if you put her in... someplace...
7349,Please!  I'll never let you down again Mother.  Never.  I promise. <BR> Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me Richard. Never me. <BR> Mother think of me always as your faithful dog ...
7350,You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding? <BR> Is that Mandrake Lord Merlin? <BR> It is. <BR> Can it truly be used for magic?
7351,Yeah just put their bill on my tab. <BR> Really? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Very well.
7352,Tell me why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way. <BR> What about Cortina? <BR> Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out --  Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.
7353,Ames here.  <u>Yessir</u>...  <BR> Okay.  Okay.  The <u>Suitcase</u> Bomb...
7354,I think ... I think ... that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would uh ... not only be a violation of international law it would be ... <BR> He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev. <BR> ... an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to become involved in Latin America.  We would lose all our friends in Latin America.
7355,I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant. <BR> You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me. <BR> Oh my God!  She's right! Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik? She was-she was beautiful. She was willing. She was real... intelligent.  Is it the old Groucho Marx joke? That-that I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?
7356,Oh brother. <BR> Did you shut the alarm off Cartman?
7357,Not a minute! <BR> Better start gettin' into your clothes. <BR> Yeah. <BR> Zeke.  Git! <BR> Yes Ma.
7358,God you're beautiful. <BR> Thank you my love.                                         ]
7359,I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing. <BR> Oh listen so the audience was a tad restless. <BR> Whatta you mean a tad restless? Oh my God I mean they hated me. <BR> No they didn't. You have a wonderful voice. <BR> No I'm gonna quit! <BR> No I'm not gonna letcha. You have a great voice. <BR> Really do you think so really? <BR> Yeah! <BR> Yeah? <BR> It's terrific. <BR> Yeah you know something? I never even took a lesson either.
7360,It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up. <BR> Well officer -- do your duty. <BR> You've got a lot to lean about homicide Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner toss her in a trunk and put her in storage. <BR> I'll bet it's been done. <BR> Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked. <BR> You think I made all this up? <BR> I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation. <BR> For instance? <BR> His wife took a trip. <BR> She -- was -- an -- invalid! <BR> You told me.  I've got to run Jeff. <BR> All right -- you don't believe me.
7361,We're not horse-trading here Wade we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing. <BR> Yah! <BR> What's the next step here Jerry? <BR> They're gonna call give me instructions for a drop. I'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow.
7362,Where are we? <BR> Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer where better than here beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?
7363,Oh I'm terribly sorry. <BR> My fault. <BR> You're not hurt are you? <BR> I don't think so. <BR> I wish you'd make sure. <BR> Why? <BR> Because usually when people find out who I am they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars. <BR> Well don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are. <BR> Thank you. <BR> Who are you? <BR> Now really -
7364,Mr. Sim when you do locate him.  Do not scare him off again.  Just watch him.  I think you can handle that. Right Mr. Sim? <BR> You got it Dr. Argon.
7365,My German's a little rusty. <BR> It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
7366,Three steps forward -- I want to get up there. <BR> Why? <BR> This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit --
7367,Oh no.  I'm off that stuff - for good. <BR> Did you have a nice time? <BR> Nice?  It was suicidally beautiful.
7368,It's Will Graham... <BR> Well it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here or two pieces of a note that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and.... <BR> Where did you get it?!
7369,Have we met? <BR> I don't think so. <BR> Did you know Sebastian well? <BR> You might say that. <BR> Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood. <BR> That's right. <BR> I'm sure you're going to love it there.
7370,No way. No fuckin' way. <BR> How the hell do you know? <BR> I blew his back out with a buffalo gun that's how I know! Now you're gonna say I didn't so you can throw me back in solitary?
7371,What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them! <BR> You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things... <BR> ...Like love... <BR> Exactly. <BR> But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
7372,No autonomic effects... that's correct. <BR> When will he be home Major? <BR> Four weeks or so right around Halloween.
7373,Look at this.  The lock is totally demolished. <BR> I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots I hope?
7374,Nothing. <BR> Too late for what Sheila? <BR> You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming? <BR> You got any broken bones? <BR> No but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it. <BR> Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo but is unable. <BR> I can't tell you Theo. <BR> Why not? <BR> I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders. <BR> Tell me Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head. <BR> I'm afraid you'll hurt him. <BR> It's Junior isn't it. <BR> I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother. <BR> He's my father.
7375,Buffy honey? <BR> Yeah? <BR> Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit... <BR> Maybe. <BR> What's Bobby gonna say? <BR> I don't know Mom; I've never met Bobby. <BR> Aren't we the chatty ones.  Kiss noise.
7376,That makes twice now you've saved my life. <BR> I didn't save your life back there. Risked it maybe -- but I didn't save shit. <BR> You see it your way I'll see it mine. You need a doctor. <BR> You know one around here?  Somebody you trust? <BR> No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital. <BR> No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to. <BR> Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run Christ...  You're a cop. <BR> Not exactly. <BR> You're with Interpol -- you're a cop. <BR> If I was a cop a real cop I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you it's about the job I have to do. <BR> And what job is that? <BR> My job Vincent a job you don't need to know about.  I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point.  It's me or nobody and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish.
7377,I'd give anything to have this in my house even for a week. <BR> ...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me. <BR> Oh really?  Well I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June. <BR> You could have a great beach house for that. <BR> Sure you could in Wildwood New Jersey. If you sold this  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration. <BR> Boy I thought Gordon was a tough businessman but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here. <BR> Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance a silk Tabriz the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray. <BR> I gather you're a decorator. <BR> You got it a great spender of other people's money. <BR> Well if you're that good you could probably do wonders at my place. <BR> Where is it? <BR> Upper West Side. <BR> Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant. <BR> Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon.  but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo.
7378,Once you are through don't stop until you reach the river. <BR> They will know you helped us if we go this way. <BR> That doesn't matter now.
7379,At least the cat comes back. <BR> You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there. <BR> I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one. <BR> Don't exist bud.
7380,Don't test me I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive -- <BR> -- confirming everything we already know -- <BR> -- I'll take the chance come morning and cops I'll be proved right --
7381,Fantastic lady.  Don't know what I'd do without her. <BR> Me neither. <BR> Y'know Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town. <BR> All of us thank you okay?
7382,Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days. <BR> Mr. Rothstein Can I be frank? You're a gambler and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer and ya wanna welch I ain't gonna beef.
7383,"Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it?? <BR> Sir? <BR> Never mind...Your pa know you're out here? <BR> Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you... <BR> Well you found me...Good work, son...Good work."
7384,You'll have to explain that Mrs. Mulwray. <BR> Why? <BR> Look I do matrimonial work It's my metiay.  When a wife tells me she's happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience.
7385,He told me he loved me and I believed him. <BR> Who told you? <BR> You don't know him. I'm so stupid.
7386,Somebody shut his lights. I guess the little guy sat in there waitin' for his buddy t'come back. <BR> Yah woulda been cold out here. <BR> Heck yah. Ya think is Dave open yet? <BR> You don't think he's mixed up in - <BR> No no I just wanna get Norm some night crawlers.
7387,The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is. <BR> You know if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
7388,Well how come we're always looking for guys for you? <BR> Because I'm the one who's single. <BR> I never even got to be single. <BR> Sure you did. <BR> Not if you don't count the sixth grade. <BR> Okay okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?
7389,Really? <BR> Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...
7390,Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me. <BR> I don't want you to hurt me. <BR> I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle. <BR> Do you care about me? <BR> Of course I do.
7391,We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about -- <BR> You have to stop this! <BR> What? What do you mean? <BR> I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now! <BR> Yes but... I'm just something you're imagining. What can I do? I'm in your head too.
7392,Dad you there?  You okay? <BR> Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
7393,As I said what seems to be the trouble? <BR> Didn't you hear me grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down? <BR> I heard you. But I'm choosing to ignore you. Epps let's go.
7394,That's a lovely dress. <BR> Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith? <BR> Mr. Smith? Oh you mean Ann Schuyler's husband? <BR> Yes. <BR> He's probably very tired. You see he's had to meet all these people personally tonight. <BR> I bet. <BR> You newspaper people have a lot of fun with him don't you? What is it you call him - the Cinderella Man?
7395,"Lloyd, what happened...? <BR> Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical- <BR> Margo, again... <BR> And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with- <BR> That's on time for Margo. <BR> Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy- <BR> It's just possible she didn't... <BR> Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant- <BR> - don't run out of adjectives, dear. <BR> - everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing... <BR> Margo hasn't done badly by it. <BR> Margo. Margo's great. She knows it. That's the trouble. She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she wants, and who's to stop her? Who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves?"
7396,The mark of the Coven. <BR> I don't understand. <BR> Ever since Adam and Eve first left the garden he followed: the serpent. Satan.  He sends his legion in the shape of men to feed on us to breed his Hell on our earth.  They are a plague upon us.
7397,I've never accepted that privilege and I'm now on French soil. <BR> I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil. <BR> This is hardly the time or the place. <BR> Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office with Mademoiselle. <BR> Captain Renault I am under your authority. Is it your order that we come to your office?
7398,They're my team too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.' <BR> I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler? <BR> The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one. <BR> If you're such a devoted fan why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night. <BR> Because I can't bear to watch. When they lose I die inside. It's like some little person named Steve just crumples up and dies. I wait for the scores. I still die hearing the scores but it's over in a second. I can't survive the game pitch by pitch inning by inning. I've done it too many times. And I can't do it anymore.
7399,But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend. <BR> Junebug that is a tough tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now. <BR> Well I'm not ready to be a mom.
7400,You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted? <BR> No... not like this... <BR> For weeks you've been asking for this... well now you have it!
7401,Years ago something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors. <BR> Attacked how? <BR> She was raped. At least that's what she claimed. <BR> You didn't believe her? <BR> No I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged. <BR> Why not? <BR> They were children of our leading citizens stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'. <BR> People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'? <BR> They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today.... <BR> And the police did nothing? <BR> EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY. <BR> How could you? <BR> I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town. <BR> The word is Mob. <BR> I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd. <BR> Who were they?
7402,Of what? <BR> A bullet to the right cerebellum. <BR> She was murdered? <BR> No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.
7403,How'd you come by this? <BR> You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward. <BR> That's what I said. <BR> You got it with you?
7404, <BR> You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it. <BR> Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech! <BR> Okay.  Please I have a headache all right? <BR> Hey you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period. <BR> I'm not getting my period. Jesus every time anything out of the ordinary happens you think that I'm getting my period!
7405,That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo? <BR> Jujitsu. <BR> Same thing isn't it? <BR> Not at all.  Similar but not the same. <BR> What's the difference? <BR> One's a lot more painful than the other.
7406,29 years...? <BR> My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.  And every night when I went to bed he sang to me...  Take me out to the ball game take me out with the crowd...
7407,Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see? <BR> Is he cleaning house? <BR> He's washing down the bathroom walls.
7408,...I've got to go home. <BR> Do you really have to go? <BR> Well... it's getting kind of late.
7409,Legate Narcissus Meridas general of the Spanish Felix Legions!  I'm proud to have you in my school!  Now show them what you can do! <BR> I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight. <BR> Then you'll die...  Just know this:  because you asked I asked:  I'm sorry but...
7410,I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF! <BR> Sir! Sir I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me. <BR> Well he missed! <BR> I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money and we'll call it even. <BR> This is the last time I ever come here.  And if I ever see you again I'm gonna break your fucking head open!
7411,How is she? <BR> She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms. <BR> Could I have that in American? <BR> It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning. <BR> So she did witness it?
7412,Oh my god. <BR> What? <BR> You just burned the desk. <BR> What's happening?
7413,I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you! <BR> Get out of here!
7414,Really? <BR> Yeah. I want you to have this picture so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
7415,Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16 1968. <BR> April 16...?  That means she was the first. <BR> Which means he probably knew her. <BR> This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
7416,Me?  No no no no...  Are you? <BR> Now Buzz what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
7417,You're really terrific you know what I mean --LINNEA rolls over and faces him. <BR> I have to go. <BR> Wrong. <BR> I have to go. He sighs. <BR> I know.
7418,You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy. <BR> I think Christmas brings out the worst in people. <BR> I guess Ron hasn't called yet. <BR> Not since November.
7419,Leo's gonna need his hands Cooch. He does quillwork. <BR> I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
7420,Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here! <BR> Okay kid I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.
7421,Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes. <BR> Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep. <BR> Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored. <BR> Yeah I get bored. <BR> I start thinking about what I'm gonna eat afterwards.
7422,Huh? Oh no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it. <BR> I guess there's probably a story behind that. <BR> There is but it's not that interesting.
7423,Bugsy you and I don't need to be in business with Maranzano. We got more jobs than we can handle. That's not the problem. <BR> So what is the problem? <BR> The minute we sell out to Maranzano that bastard is gonna have you knocked off.
7424,Oh laugh if you will but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936 you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side. <BR> And got well paid for it on both occasions. <BR> The winning side would have paid you much better. <BR> Maybe. Well it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here. <BR> I have my orders. <BR> Oh I see. Gestapo spank.
7425,Apipoulai! <BR> Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
7426,Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this but can you open the door? It's us Hugo your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again. <BR> Alex the key is in the keyhole on the other side. <BR> So? <BR> Open it. <BR> You want me to kick it open? <BR> Yes. <BR> Now? <BR> Yes. <BR> All right. No problem.
7427,Say it again. <BR> Alla puttanesca. <BR> Isn't she great? What did I tell you? A talent.
7428,The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline? <BR> I? -- Oh no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
7429,Interesting suit. <BR> Why thank you sir. <BR> off the peg? <BR> Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...
7430,Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP. <BR> As long as it gets us out of here
7431,You have to smoke so early in the morning? <BR> It's good with coffee. <BR> So's a donut.
7432,There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean? <BR> No. <BR> I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich earthy kind of... alive... No. No that's not right. Can you smell it? <BR> Maybe it's because I live here. <BR> That must be it. It's a great smell.
7433,Today's your lucky day Sami. <BR> Yeah I can see that. <BR> Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them. <BR> Me? <BR> You lived there. You know the city. <BR> I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.
7434,We really must go Mr. President. <BR> Don't forget the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your Maker ...  Don't forget to be on God's side.
7435,I'm serious. <BR> We didn't just have sex in the bathroom? <BR> No.
7436,What time is it? <BR> Eight o'clock. You got to go. <BR> Did she show up? <BR> Nope. <BR> Do you mind if I check upstairs? <BR> I can't have you do that nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day. <BR> I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here. <BR> Don't worry about it.
7437,The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine. <BR> I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
7438,Isn't that the point? <BR> Yeah well I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
7439,I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you. <BR> Yeah whoops I came. <BR> You look way pretty Kim. <BR> I know.  I like your little outfit.
7440,What is it? <BR> Is this you? <BR> Where'd you get this? <BR> It was left in my hotel room well not really mine.  You're saying it's not you? <BR> I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me? <BR> Well... the red bra. <BR> Okay. <BR> I thought...
7441,Goddamn didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them -- <BR> Christ can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead! <BR> Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself! <BR> He's alone tired hunted and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling! <BR> Anytime you want to go home Sergeant...consider yourself dismissed.
7442,You're nothing but a... a... <BR> The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
7443,Thank you. <BR> When you see Jimmy tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. Okay?
7444,She's working as fast as she can Icarus.  It will be ready soon. <BR> It's ready now I know it is. <BR> She says it's not. <BR> She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose. <BR> She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain. <BR> She let it escape because she wants me to die. <BR> Don't be a child Icarus.  She is just another scientist and like all scientists she doesn't care about anything outside the world of the laboratory.
7445,Sorry to trouble you Coco. <BR> It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong? <BR> No no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind. <BR> His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever. <BR> Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing <BR> Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that. <BR> Thanks Coco. I'll let you know.
7446,Susie!  You gotta help me! <BR> Daniel what are you doing here? <BR> Please Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me! <BR> Sorry Daniel I'm a physicist not a psychiatrist. <BR> No something is really wrong... look!
7447,Just tell me his title. <BR> I don't know titles. <BR> Is he on the level of Assistant to the President or not?
7448,These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy. <BR> Ahh now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard -
7449,He gave us a perfectly good description and we're on it now so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his either. He's under close guard at the courthouse pending a prison transfer. The next plane Officer. <BR> 
7450,South Dakota...  Did I do something unsatisfactory Sir? <BR> No Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.
7451,Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia. <BR> Why attack Russia? <BR> Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here. <BR> Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson? <BR> I have detailed files. <BR> I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything.
7452,Let's get the fuck out of here shall we ladies? <BR> Anything goes wrong head for your homes just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard. <BR> Personally I'll be calling the President of the United States.

7454,It's a poison arrow tree frog. <BR> Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
7455,Three agents killed by bad weather... <BR> ... And by you Mrs. Peel ... <BR> Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ... <BR> ... And by you Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin? <BR> Not that I know of.  Explanation? <BR> According to Dr. Darling you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.

7458,It made me realize something. I'm an idiot. <BR> Really?
7459,Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer. <BR> I promised Chloe we'd come here. <BR> Oh give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's. <BR> I'm not taking her to a bar. <BR> Why not? I grew up in bars. It's fun for a kid.
7460,What do you think? <BR> I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit. <BR> It's always how you would do it. This is my version. <BR> You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime. <BR> Why so you could humiliate me? <BR> No I wanted to make a painting of you.
7461,"All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right? <BR> Hmmmm. Five Stars huh?  Is that stupid, Wesley?"

7463,You ever see a palm tree Homer? <BR> He ain't never been outta Maine!
7464,Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is what she's done? <BR> Old wives' tales born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth! <BR> Then tell me this isn't true! That your concern for your play and career is one thing - and that poor frightened hysterical girl another - and that your concern for her has nothing to do with either your play or your career!
7465,Git up. I got sump'n to show you. <BR> Whatsa matter? <BR> It's them white things made outa dish-stuff like in the catalogues!
7466,Is it fresh? <BR> It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
7467,Bye. <BR> Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here follow me.
7468,Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em. <BR> You don't love ME. <BR> No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well to be quite honest I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people... <BR> What -- rape? <BR> No. It isn't rape then is it? <BR> Oh get it over with. <BR> I don't suppose... no... <BR> What? <BR> I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all? <BR> What d'you expect? You come in here burn my village kill my family and try to rape me...
7469,Willingham when he tossed his cell took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place... <BR> Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books... <BR> Where? <BR> Library of Congress.
7470,Where are you transmitting from? <BR> Queens New York. <BR> Whatta ya know.  Bayside born and raised. <BR> I thought these things were for talkin' around the world. <BR> 15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want. <BR> I can't believe people are still using these things.
7471,Mm... I wouldn't worry about it. <BR> What... what do you mean? <BR> It's out of your hands.
7472,No more fuckin' dirty work! <BR> No no no no! <BR> Take him out! Take this motherfucker out!
7473,Holy shit what've you been doin' out here? <BR> Honey come here.
7474,Yeah no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there! <BR> And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.
7475,I don't understand why you do that. <BR> Why I do what? <BR> That. <BR> Why I give pennies? <BR> Yeah. Why you give money. <BR> Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage. <BR> That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do. <BR> What are you talking about? <BR> Whenever you see someone who's really messed up especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum you pass them by. <BR> So. <BR> So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks. <BR> So. You never know when you can end up like that. <BR> Right. <BR> I'll tell you why. Because when I was little I had a fat cousin cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off. <BR> Shut up. <BR> I'm telling you the truth. And after that I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did.
7476,Leo's gotta get to burial Brother. He's gotta make the journey. <BR> What journey? <BR> Tell him Ray.
7477,It's coming.  Hold her down. <BR> What's that Frank? <BR> Three legs. <BR> That's too many. <BR> Backup? <BR> It's coming.
7478,What's wrong with you? <BR> You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me. <BR> Interesting. <BR> I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter? <BR> No. <BR> Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.
7479,You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff? <BR> Whatever.
7480,Oh let the poor devil alone. <BR> I did not ask your advice.
7481,"How are you doing? <BR> Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank. <BR> Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling. <BR> Oh, and what did you do? <BR> I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out. <BR> That's impressive. How did you do that? <BR> I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again. <BR> We?"
7482,"Elena, it's not what you think. It's not a big plot. Honestly. Honestly. I don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me. I don't feel good about it. I know I've done what I didn't want to do. I don't know -- <BR> Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession. <BR> Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up. <BR> Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather talk to anyone else but you."
7483,Good morning gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway. <BR> Oh here you are Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation? <BR> But the situation is perfectly clear If you will allow me -- 
7484,How's your stomach? <BR> Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill? <BR> Not yet. Listen Norman I want... <BR> They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.
7485,It's not my alibi to tell -- <BR> I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you. <BR> Really? Thanks.
7486,Her fucking head was caved in. <BR> So I didn't fucking do it! <BR> She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Micheal goes down we all go down.
7487,I like you kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you? <BR> Mr. Reuben I swear to God they were out of line. <BR> Last time maybe with the Puerto Ricans but these were nice Jewish boys. <BR> They were out of line -- <BR> They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth. <BR> That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom -- <BR> Bobby I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand. <BR> I'll work it off. <BR> Not driving Jess you won't. <BR> What? <BR> You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes Bobby and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul. <BR> So that's it. I'm out? <BR> I didn't say that. <BR> Then what are you saying? <BR> Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep. <BR> I don't understand. <BR> It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you. <BR> I don't want to drive another girl Max. The only reason I'm -- <BR> Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out? <BR> No. <BR> Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom. <BR> I know. <BR> Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say? <BR> Yeah. Sorry. <BR> I got a way we make everybody happy. <BR> Yeah. <BR> We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent. <BR> Ruiz knows about this? <BR> Ruiz wants to go alone but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth. <BR> What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity. <BR> Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky? <BR> You told him you liked him. <BR> That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van. <BR> He'll work it off. <BR> I don't know the kid and what little I do scares me. <BR> He's good people Mr. Reuben. I swear. <BR> You vouch for him?
7488,I guess at this point I'm what the French call 'de trop'... <BR> Maybe just a little around the edges.
7489,You know Bienstock there's something funny about those two new girls. <BR> Funny?  In what way? <BR> I don't know - but I can feel it right here.  That's one good thing about ulcers - it's like a burglar alarm going off inside you.
7490,We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning. <BR> We own a small family grocery store.
7491,Do you have something to say? <BR> No. <BR> Then keep your mouth shut.
7492,"You know, Fred, they sell tickets. <BR> Sir? <BR> They sell tickets to an impeachment. Like a fucking circus ... Okay, so they impeach me.  Then it's a question of mathematics.  How many votes do we have in the Senate?"
7493,Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn that's eerie. <BR> You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour? <BR> What's a jizz-mopper? <BR> He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off. <BR> Nudie booth? <BR> Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth? <BR> I guess not.
7494,Uh actually I tend to shy away from that kind of thing. <BR> Excuse me for asking but you aren't married are you?
7495,No problem. Look I... <BR> You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low. <BR> Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter? <BR> You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.

7497,And that is how you talk to a girl Rat. Voila. You can't miss. <BR> I think I've got it. Once I get going I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean I hardly know her. <BR> You wuss. It's no problem. One person says something to the other and that's how it starts...
7498,You know what I mean? Like the tip o'your nose and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps... you get excited. <BR> Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know I like you I really mean it. I really do like you. <BR> You- Do you love me? <BR> Do I love you? <BR> That's the key question. <BR> Yeah. <BR> I know you've only known me a short while. <BR> Well I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah yeah...  yeah. Do you love me? <BR> I-uh love is uh is too weak a word for what... <BR> Yeah. <BR> I love you.  You know I lo-ove you I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you. <BR> Yeah. <BR> Don't you think I do? <BR> I dunno.
7499,How so? <BR> Because if there's more than one party involved if we really are working for different people then perhaps some of us are on different sides.  Your orders might be different from mine.
7500,Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything? <BR> They thought it was a publicity stunt. <BR> Oh my God. How could it happen? <BR> They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie. <BR> It's a copycat killer I knew this would happen. That fucking movie.
7501,"You've... <BR> In the car. <BR> Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right back, Dot."
7502,I don't see why we have to invite everyone. <BR> Kimberly it's the senior dance.
7503,"What was it? <BR> When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins. <BR> What killed those men? <BR> What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect. <BR> I'll know soon enough. <BR> What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved. <BR> A plague? <BR> The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon. <BR> Negotiating with whom? <BR> I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government. <BR> And they tell me I'm paranoid. <BR> Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late."
7504,May I help you? <BR> Yeah hi I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski. <BR> Yes please have a seat. He'll be right with you.
7505,Right. <BR> Tell you what. If you do remember seeing any of these guys maybe you could give me a phone on this number any time you like.
7506,Bye. And thanks... Nathalie gently closes the door eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room... <BR> Oů est passé ton salon? <BR> Mon bureau coűtait trop cher. <BR> Eh bien... Tes sűr que tas besoin de moi?  La petite ma lair assez bien foutue non?
7507,What's that? What's it called? <BR> One cervical stabilizer two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette one small; one medium speculum one large; two vulsellum forceps. <BR> There ain't no *almost* about this stuff Homer--ain't that right?
7508,I emptied it. <BR> Felt a little light. <BR> Drop it.
7509,You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight? <BR> Yeah probably.
7510,I want to secure it. <BR> Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what you want to bury it? Is that it?
7511,Okay well that's something. <BR> So we've got guns kitchen knives pipes fire and sticks.
7512,I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on... <BR> Worry about your own goddamn lunch! <BR> Tell him what you told me.
7513,Does Mr Gluck call for his messages? <BR> Absolutely sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning sir. <BR> Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that? <BR> Got it. Puppies.
7514,You came up here on a hunch Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him or from your sister herself? <BR> Not even a hunch. Just hope. <BR> With a little checking I could get to believe you. <BR> I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
7515,"He didn't mention a park. <BR> This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed. <BR> I don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm drain."
7516, <BR>  <BR>  <BR> Honey don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things. <BR>  <BR> Would you rather me be making love to him using your name or making love to you using his name?
7517,Whos the money man? <BR> Who?  Martin... Hes Martin...
7518,Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call. <BR> Smokey Three: thumbs up am I right? <BR> The best Burtless movie ever made.
7519,So uh... <BR> What? <BR> What? <BR> You were going to say something. <BR> What was I trying to say? Oh yes I think we think or at least I suppose we think -- am I right?
7520,You thirsty? <BR> Yeah I feel dehydrated. <BR> You got any money? <BR> Three pennies and a ball of lint. <BR> You down with the boost? <BR> Unzip my pack yo.
7521,-- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality. <BR> Jesus Karen you're breaking my heart here --
7522,"What would be true, then. <BR> Well, you  said it yourself, earlier, and if I may rephrase, that the success of the President, in the Polls... <BR> ...as of today, 89% favorable. <BR> Eighty-<u>nine</u> percent favorable, is based not on <u>events</u>..."
7523,Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this? <BR> The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
7524,He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here? <BR> Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket? <BR> <i></i> HEY!! HEY YOU!!
7525,I don't know no Buzz Fazeli. <BR> Look Sid a Buzz Burger. The Faz's favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth  and pulls his burger away from Sid.
7526,At first it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together. <BR> You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
7527,Any more O -- ? <BR> You guys are through... <BR> Whatcha got left ... ? <BR>  <BR> We'll take it... <BR> It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx... <BR> We'll take it.
7528,I don't think... <BR> C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door. <BR> No.
7529,Youre wrong about my being there though. Carlos borrowed my car that day his had broken down...  Leon saw it like you assumed I was there thought hed wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up with the tape you found...  Leon got his lift and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it confronted Carlos threatened to tell the police about the hotel... I dont know how he knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos talked too much... My husband did not tell me... You more or less guessed the rest...  I didnt know any of this before you left for Los Angeles. <BR> You dont say. <BR> That my brother my husband and your Mr Friedman were linked that much I had guessed. But that my husband had killed Leon? No.
7530,But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even -- <BR> I'll take you home if you'd like. <BR> God.  You would.  Come on Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment. <BR> Maybe we should just kiss. <BR> ... We could try that.
7531,I still don't know what you're getting at. Right now I want to take my nap. It's important that I- <BR> - it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer. <BR> Champion to champion. <BR> Not with me you're no champion. You're stepping way up in class. <BR> Addison will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so I can take my nap! <BR> Very well plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I what I am about to say.  Lloyd may leave Karen but he will not leave Karen for you. <BR> What do you mean by that? <BR> More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play discuss your dreams or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it. <BR> What have you got to do with it? <BR> Everything. Because after tonight you will belong to me. <BR> I can't believe my ears... <BR> A dull cliche. <BR> Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama... <BR> So does the history of the world for the past twenty years. I don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this frankly I had hoped that you would somehow have known - have taken it for granted that you and I... <BR> ... taken it for granted? That you and I...
7532,Right-well Santa Claus will have sunstroke. <BR> Max there's no crime there's no mugging. <BR> There's no economic crime you know but there's-there's ritual religious- cult murders you know there's wheat- germ killers out here. <BR> While you're out here Max I want you to see some of my TV show. And we're invited to a big Christmas party.
7533,House 25. Number's on the door. <BR> Okay mister. Whatcha payin'? <BR> Two and a half cents. <BR> Two an' a half! Say mister a man can't make his dinner on that. <BR> Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it. <BR> But--but how we gonna eat? <BR> Look I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it take it. If you don't turn right around and beat it. <BR> Which way is House 25?
7534,Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds! <BR> Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there... <BR> Oh shit. <BR> And we were blasted and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room like getting dressed like getting ready to go to go to Disco
7535,"Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone? <BR> Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!"
7536,All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected someone like me. <BR> Is that what you think? <BR> I'm just making a point.  You have no idea what you're asking.  How much trust two people need to do something like this.
7537,It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk? <BR> Ain't no place safe. <BR> Look...I know you have no reason to trust me. I've got friends in the Cave. I got some stuff comin' out this mornin'. I'm gonna try to get off the island.
7538,I thought we were going to talk. Last night. <BR> Oh. Well. I...
7539,"Please. <BR> Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places. <BR> I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me Rick it's true. I didn't know. <BR> It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. Richard dear I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."""""" <BR> Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel. <BR> Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey? <BR> I didn't count the days. <BR> Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out."
7540,Here you try. <BR> No I'd better not. <BR> Sure sure give go. <BR> Yeah?
7541,Give me a cigarette. <BR> Right now? <BR> Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!! <BR> Why are you driving?  You're not French you don't live here you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?
7542,This honey doesn't handle so good in town... <BR> No nuh-uh never in a million years!
7543,Something bad happened to Del and me didn't it? <BR> Yeah hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep everything's gonna be fine. <BR> Sue Ann I'm sorry about all this but I just know there's something special out there for me...
7544,I have a confession to make.  Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you as a practical joke. <BR> Seriously?  What did they say? <BR> They said five hundred.  I said six. They said the man in the gray flannel suit.  I think I said you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?
7545,Uh-huh. <BR> We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there. <BR> And his wife? <BR> She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss this guy Gustafson he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is. <BR> Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home? <BR> His wife's in the hospital has been for a couple months. The big C. <BR> Oh my. <BR> And this Shep Proudfoot character he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps and he's at large. <BR> Boy this thing is really... geez. <BR> Well they're all out on the wire. Well you know... <BR> Yah. Well I just can't thank you enough Detective Sibert this cooperation has been outstanding.
7546,Hey!! <BR> She's sick! <BR> No she's NOT -- <BR> I'll have to perform one of my...operations! <BR> NO-O-O... Don't touch her!  NO!
7547,Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally? <BR>  <BR> I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him. <BR> Fine. That's all there is to it then. <BR> No! That's not all there is to it! I love you too--I *know* I do. <BR> Okay okay--I know you do too. <BR> It's a good thing I didn't have that baby isn't it?
7548,Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then... <BR> Your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars.
7549,It's lovely... I really like your aquarium. <BR> Yeah well at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat... <BR> Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men... <BR> Oh I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
7550,Did you get some sleep? <BR> Sure. <BR> Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something. <BR> Where's the girl? <BR> Upstairs. Why? <BR> I want to see her. <BR> ...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her?
7551,Doctor Jacobson? <BR> Yes? <BR> We need you urgently in C Theatre. <BR> Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 .... <BR> It is urgent sir. <BR> Okay.....
7552,Look at these guys. <BR> Yeah. <BR> Oh that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean? <BR> Oh! Italian right? <BR> Yeah he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract you know what I mean? <BR> Oh yeah. <BR> No I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet. <BR> Oh yeah? <BR> And there's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest.
7553,Two. <BR> So you'll relieve me at 2:30... <BR> And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit.
7554,Just for the record: what are the rest of your names? <BR> Donald W. Blackburn M.D.
7555,She is the soul of that statue. <BR> I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
7556,It'll be a night to remember. It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted. The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one... <BR> All paved with diamonds and gold? <BR> You know me better than that. <BR> Paved with what then? <BR> Stars.
7557,You don't know? <BR> Know what? <BR> I'll be asking the questions.  Last night you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts? <BR> No. <BR> A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that? <BR> I was asleep. <BR> I didn't say what time the assault occurred. <BR> You said last night. I went to bed pretty early. <BR> The assault took place at approximately seven thirty. <BR> I went to bed around seven.
7558,Settle what? <BR> C ' mon! <BR> I don't wanta fight you I wanta thank you.  Let's have a drink and forget this-- <BR> God damn it you fucking virgin prick--step outside.
7559,I'm ready now. <BR> Alright Mr. Pritchett let me just sign the damn thing.
7560,You're going to Hollywood - aren't you?  From the trunks you're packing you must be going to stay a long time. <BR> I might. <BR> That spilled drink is going to ruin your carper.
7561,How's the leg? <BR> Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
7562,Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do. <BR> See you later. <BR> Thanks a lot Brad. I really appreciate it.
7563,You're hurt -- <BR> Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
7564,Light in those passages ain't so good. <BR> I'm telling you I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
7565,Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops.  Look I bore myself silly.  Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese? <BR> That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat? <BR> No. <BR> Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman I guess. <BR> Odd desire for anyone. <BR> Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away. <BR> What did you see? <BR> ... Terror.
7566,It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor. <BR> I'm afraid in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way. <BR> The present situation? <BR> I mean the reasons for my coming here. <BR> We're very curious about that too. Would you care to talk about it? <BR> I'd be glad to.  Not now of course -- with you alone. <BR> Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President-- <BR> This is not a personal matter Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet. <BR> I -- I'm not sure I understand-- <BR> I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth. <BR> I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances. <BR> I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations? <BR> You know about the United Nations? <BR> We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately we've been getting your television also. <BR> You must have a rather strange impression of us. <BR> The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle.
7567,Come on! <BR> Where's Kelly? <BR> She's with Sarah!
7568,We're going to Atlantic City for the honeymoon. <BR> I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales. <BR> I been thinkin'... <BR> Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin' we end up makin' money. <BR> We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do. <BR> Like a party for all our friends. <BR> Italians Jews Irish. One big party. Course some guys don't get along.
7569, <BR> Yes. <BR> I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it. <BR> Yes. <BR> I'm pretty nervous. Are you? <BR> Yes. <BR> 
7570,Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches? <BR> Uh -- sure.
7571,I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  What right did then have to show up here? <BR> They have every right Chuck. <BR> They send us because they want us to change or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same.
7572,You are the most desirable creature that ever walked. <BR> If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me. <BR> He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous look think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead. <BR> Do you really think so? <BR> You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you! <BR> But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear? <BR> EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY DRESSING UP HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GREATEST JOY BUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO BE DISCREET THERE'S ONE THING YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT THAT'S A STRAPLESS BACKLESS CLASSICAL LITTLE BLACK
7573,There is one thing left to do... Excalibur... And you must do it Perceval. Leave my wounds I command you. <BR> I cannot-- <BR> --Take Excalibur. Find a pool of calm water and throw the sword into it.
7574,It was at that. <BR> A lot of people died. <BR> I've seen a lot of people die before. <BR> I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it? <BR> You don't.  You just learn to live with it. <BR> I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't. <BR> We live in a singular world my friend. <BR> I never really thought I was part of the world you move in Sam to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun. <BR> You might be a hired gun Vincent but I got a feeling you cost more than two bits.
7575,Wow!  Cool! <BR> Whadda ya think? <BR> Oh this looks GREAT Mom!
7576,What I've heard so far it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first cause like I said the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix. <BR> You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape? <BR> All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version.
7577,He making the drop? <BR> Nah man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy. <BR> What's his name? <BR> Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon. <BR> So when's the drop. <BR> To be honest man I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
7578,It's been too long. <BR> Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.
7579,It would never have worked Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick twisted dreamer. <BR> Maybe I should get help. <BR> It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why our Strategic Defense boys would have  -- <BR> You're right you're right Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But well...  ...there is this new rocket the XK 101. <BR> The XK 101. Luthor that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system only the President himself can push that button. <BR> I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
7580,Yeah I guess it would be good for us to get away for a while.  Maybe Rudolf got the same idea.  Dogs need a change of scene too from time to time. <BR> Someone nice will find him if he gets lost.
7581,What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker? <BR> Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
7582,...And here is the key to the mini- bar. Room and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant as well as one fifty in incidentals. <BR> What's 'incidentals?' <BR> Phone room service mini-bar. Any additional expense. If you need anything you can push the button marked 'Concierge' and they'll be able to help you.
7583,Hello. John Triplette. <BR> Hello. <BR> Glad to meet you.
7584,Go Doctor. <BR> What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention. <BR> The death of my father. <BR> Tell me. Don't lie or I'll know.
7585,Your a real philosopher. <BR> Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.
7586,Got it. <BR> Dad I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard. <BR> How? <BR> Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together... <BR> All right I'm with you.  I just hope we know what the hell we're doing.
7587,What happened? <BR> I got pinched in the elevator. <BR> Well now you know how the other half lives. <BR> And I'm not even pretty. <BR> They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull. <BR> I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here Joe. Let's blow. <BR> Blow where? <BR> You promised - the minute we hit Florida we were going to beat it. <BR> How can we?  We're broke. <BR> We can get a job with another band. A male band. <BR> Listen stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country. <BR> But this is so humiliating. <BR> So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel? <BR> All right all right!  But how long can we keep this up? <BR> What's the beef?  We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish - <BR> What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar. <BR> Me?  After Sugar? <BR> I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick - <BR> What are you talking about?  Sugar and me we're just like sisters. <BR> Yeah?  Well I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
7588,After all you work with a man for a certain length of time you come to know him his habits his values and so forth. Well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't. <BR> And Mulwray isn't? <BR> He never even kids about it. <BR> Maybe he takes it very seriously.
7589,Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register. <BR> Again? <BR> Please.
7590,Jesus Christ. <BR> You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church. <BR> Why not? <BR> Tradition. <BR> What the hell is going on?
7591,You lost twenty-five dollars once before that too near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th to be exact. <BR> You got a real good memory Star. <BR> I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus you were skinny. <BR> What do you have to buy? <BR> Feed mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids. <BR> Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland. <BR> What? <BR> Grand Old Opera -- <BR> I hate that music. <BR> I know that Star.
7592,Call the Coastguard? <BR> Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
7593,Goodnight honey. <BR> Mom... When is the war gonna be over? <BR> I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly huh? <BR> Oh I don't care I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off. <BR> Oh.
7594,This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster. <BR> No Fidget I... <BR> Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it. <BR> No... <BR> Here. Swallow.
7595,Oh Smythe some bicarbonate of soda quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me. <BR> I've anticipated it madame. The bicarbonate is ready.
7596,Oh oh no I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show. <BR> Well... H-h huh... Oh good... Yes I'll tell him.
7597,That's it. The Stronghold. Get us in there we got a chance. <BR> We're in there. We're in there --
7598, <BR> Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
7599,What's this about? <BR> Your good friend Leo Fast Elk. <BR> You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well let me tell you something about Leo Man -- <BR> 
7600,Brad! <BR> I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
7601,You're shattering all my myths. <BR> About what? <BR> Your people. <BR> Oh  you mean black people!
7602,Be quiet. <BR> -Auditorium nostrum- <BR> Stop. <BR> -In nomine sanctus esperitu- <BR> Stop!
7603,What are they doing? <BR> Making the key to the throne.
7604,Did you feel that? <BR> Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years. <BR> Not that.
7605,Well that's news to me. The name's Tom. <BR> Mmmm-hmm. Where's the uh 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live? <BR> Edinburgh. <BR> And where might that be? <BR> Scotland. <BR> Well word on the street is you're Welsh. <BR> I am. <BR> A rose by any other name would --
7606,New hat?  Jill's up I see. <BR> For a while. <BR> How's she doing? <BR> Okay. She's fine. <BR> You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party give me a call okay? I'm off.
7607,So Jimmy you know where this address is? <BR> Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem. <BR> Harlem? What is it a restaurant? <BR> You don't know where you're going? <BR> No. Just the cross streets. <BR> Well this is the corner.
7608,Andy man thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket. <BR> My jacket? Gee great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!
7609,We must obey our emperor and the Senate. <BR> I met with Falco and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
7610,Did you ever go back to see her? <BR> Once about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment and he couldn't tell me where she was. <BR> She probably died. <BR> Yeah probably. <BR> Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you. <BR> I guess so. I never thought of it that way. <BR> It was a good deed Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her. <BR> I lied to her and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed. <BR> You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it. <BR> Anything for art eh Paul? <BR> I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use. <BR> And now you've got your Christmas story don't you? <BR> Yes I suppose I do.
7611,We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all! <BR> Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
7612,I carried that rifle in World War I.  This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria.  The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College.  Class of 1672.  It goes on. <BR> That's why Smith called you MacLeod. <BR> Yes. <BR> He knows about you. <BR> He is older than I. <BR> What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction. <BR> Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work. <BR> That's insane. <BR> Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance. <BR> Of bodies. <BR> I didn't kill the watchman. <BR> You killed those other two. <BR> Not the same. <BR> What about that family in '31? <BR> Sometimes innocents become involved. <BR> You and your buddy make a real team don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between. <BR> There are differences. <BR> You kill with your left hand? <BR> I haven't killed _you_. <BR> Is that a threat?
7613,You know what Sanford told me?  <BR> I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married. <BR> Julie Dwyer died. <BR> Yeah right. <BR> No I'm serious.
7614,No one saw me but the Italian and a dog. I blew up their generator. They thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. It might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up... <BR> Were both thinking the same thing right? <BR> Do you know a friendly cop?
7615,We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right dear? <BR> Of course dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
7616,Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter <BR> Gee why Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt. <BR> Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt? <BR> Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.
7617,Who is the kid? <BR> The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails allegedly.
7618,But what about lunch? <BR> I'll have it for supper.  So long.
7619,We got a helluva tide this month. <BR> Could you just keep that crowd back please?
7620, <BR> Doesn't want you thinking too much huh? <BR> No.
7621,Could we sail to Venice? <BR> Sure. I love Venice. <BR> I have to go to Venice. <BR> See Venice and die isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die don't you? Okay Venice is on the list. <BR> And Rome. <BR> Do you ski?  Don't tell me -- you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent.  Marge -- Ripley can't ski. We'll have to teach him that too. Have you ever known such low class?
7622,I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States. <BR> And who are you?
7623,"Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not. <BR> Can you do that? <BR> I am Chief of Police. I can do anything I want.  You want to come?"
7624,Maybe the road's out. <BR> I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it.  An' these here are our own people all of 'em. I don't like this.
7625,Tubbs it's me. <BR> Well where are ya what are ya drunk? <BR> No...I'm in some trouble... <BR> Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law? <BR> Yeah...
7626,You see what you're doing don't you? <BR> What am I doing? <BR> You're charming the boy. <BR> Hey Toyota. He asked me a question. <BR> Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury. <BR> That's my cousin Angelo.
7627,Mr. Mannheim got a sure thing.  Anacott Steel. <BR> No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?  Remember there're no short cuts son quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out. <BR> You're right Mr. Mannheim but you gotta get to the big time first then you can be a pillar and do good things. <BR> Can't get a little bit pregnant Bud. <BR> It's a winner Mr. Mannheim trust me -- buy. 
7628,If you're beached why are we doing this?  For practice? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Then why are we futzing around the dock?  We can make a few bucks working at the beach.
7629,Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like. <BR> Okay.
7630,You're going to be ok William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you. <BR> Who are you kidding Doc? You or me?
7631,We have a problem. <BR> Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
7632,I don't think either Metropolitan or National should cover the story.  I don't think we should cover the story period. <BR> Go on. <BR> It's not that we're using unnamed sources that bothers me or that everything we print the White House denies or that almost no other papers are reprinting our stuff.
7633,Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today? <BR> Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle. <BR> That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today? <BR> Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful. <BR> Tell me about the interesting people you met won't you? <BR> They are... sinister.  They want to kill me. <BR> That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow? <BR> Stay alive.
7634,Take 'er on down Al. I'll sign. <BR> We gonna stay ain't we? <BR> You're tootin' we're gonna stay. 
7635,You cold James? <BR> A little. <BR> So what are you doing out here? <BR> It's colder in there. <BR> You're right.
7636,"I like women who wear mismatched earrings. <BR> Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight. <BR> What do you mean? <BR> I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly."
7637,"My god... <BR> The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization. <BR> This isn't Colonization, it's spontaneous repopulation. All our work... if it's true, then they've been using us all along. We've been laboring under a lie!"
7638,You don't like coming here do you? <BR> It's okay. <BR> But you don't like coming here. Be honest Walter. <BR> Honest? No. <BR> Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here? <BR> Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch. <BR> Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch? <BR> Forget it. <BR> Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name. <BR> Rosen? I don't have a problem with that. <BR> Because if you did I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung. <BR> I don't need someone else.
7639,Go on Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with? <BR> Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself! <BR> Well that's the only way it's gonna happen man.  Do it!  Come on you want to do it.  You're gonna die Johnny.  Five more seconds.  Four...
7640,Now what did I do to deserve this? <BR> Come on at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.
7641,Pretty low all around. <BR> We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship but it's probably worth looking around.
7642,Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate. <BR> This can't be. <BR> You are not dead boy.  Accept it. <BR> This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity. <BR> You'd have to die first.  Aqui.
7643,I just wanna get out of here. <BR> And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand? <BR> I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake. <BR> You're fuckin' right you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Get out of here. <BR> Thank you.
7644,Keep your mind off her. <BR> She's real eat drink and be merry girl. <BR> And she'll end up fat alcoholic and miserable. <BR> Speaking of misery Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone. <BR> Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness. <BR> And some man will lose his. <BR> Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction? <BR> Well the salesman could be available soon. <BR> He and his wife splitting up? <BR> It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night in the rain carrying his sample case. <BR> Isn't he a salesman? <BR> Now what could he sell at three in the morning? <BR> Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up. <BR> He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
7645,Now who's show up at this hour? It's time people went home - hold that coat up...  ... whose is it? <BR> Some Hollywood movie star her plane got in late. <BR> Discouraging isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold... <BR> Hollywood. <BR> Tell me Eve - how are things with you? Happy?
7646,I'm ready to rock Angelo.  Where you want me? <BR> Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup got it? <BR> Got it. <BR> Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling.
7647,Winifred. <BR> Hi! Star. <BR> Winifred the kids want you home and so do I. <BR> I won first prize. <BR> Come on.
7648,I don't like this. I don't like it one bit. <BR> Louisa Vail. Remember her Cyrus? <BR> You shut your mouth! You shut your mouth now!
7649,"Don't know where she got Marie but Samuels"""" figures. Her boy friend's name is Sam.  Was she in disguise? Or do you want to check the picture again?"" <BR> I didn't lie to you. I just have trouble keeping track of... time."
7650,Expecting anyone? <BR> What? <BR> Were you expecting anyone? Tonight? <BR> No. <BR> Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to? <BR> No one. I promise. <BR> Who have you talked to? <BR> No one. <BR> If I think you're lying --
7651,We got the guy we got the guy we got the Guy! <BR> 
7652,He's chasing us! I don't believe it. <BR> Full throttle! To port!
7653,Those are priceless sculptures. <BR> I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!
7654,Not lately.  Did you check messages? <BR> I thought you did.
7655,We're goosed! Goosed by God! <BR> Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
7656,But what does *that* prove? <BR> Look at 'em! Same yella han'bill-- 800 pickers wanted. Awright this man wants 800 men. So he prints up 5000 a them han'bills an' maybe 20000 people sees 'em. An' maybe two-three thousan' starts movin wes' account a this han'bill. Two- three thousan' folks that's crazy with worry headin' out for 800 jobs! Does that make sense?
7657,You're not my list. <BR> I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name -- <BR> -- I'm sure you did.
7658,And where is...? <BR> Ruiz? Oh he ain't here. <BR> No? <BR> Nah see Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He you know he tied in with the club. Set us up so you know you feel at home. <BR> Well I didn't care for the club much. And I must say I didn't care for him either. <BR> Well he ain't gonna be around no more. <BR> Pity. What's say we have a drink?
7659,Are you telling me Friedman didnt tell you I was here looking for him? <BR> If he had youd be dead. <BR> So why didnt he? <BR> What do you think huh? <BR> I think youd rather not know what I think. <BR> Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldnt go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk. <BR> So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me? <BR> Thats the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what youre up to eh French-fuck?
7660,Oh Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful! <BR> Hilarious. No I just keep all of my old comics down here and I want to show you one of them. <BR> Oh God you're one of those guys... <BR> You're gonna like this I promise.
7661,There's something I gotta take care of. Something I need to tell you about. <BR> Okay... <BR> I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and uh he... <BR> Honey what is it?  Just tell me. <BR> I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio. <BR> I know.  He loves that thing. <BR> No.  Not our Johnny.  I mean it's Johnny...but not now...in the future.
7662,"And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about? <BR> Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself? <BR> Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist? <BR> Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top. <BR> Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today? <BR> Got a meeting uptown. <BR> Right o'. <BR> Up the organization!  Bastard."
7663,What time did you say they would be there? <BR> The plane is in at seven so I'd say about eight. <BR> Any bodyguards? <BR> Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver. <BR> Fine.
7664,I said I've been real tired. <BR> Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it. <BR> What's wrong with her. <BR> Oh just about everything I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough though.. She's tough. <BR> What did you say your name was? <BR> Green.
7665,Detective Bedsoe. <BR> Lieutenant. <BR> Congratulations.
7666,Who is it? <BR> What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...
7667,Okay this is no laughing matter. <BR> No it's not. Paulie is virile by the way. He was very good in... chair.
7668,Sylvia Plath. <BR> M'hm... <BR> Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic by the college-girl mentality. <BR> Oh yeah. <BR> Oh sorry. <BR> Right. Well I don't know I mean uh some of her poems seem - neat you know. <BR> Neat? <BR> Neat yeah. <BR>  <BR> Oh... oh well you see now now uh that's my dad that's Father-and that's my... brother Duane. <BR> Duane? <BR> Yeah right Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall and that's Sadie. <BR> Well who's Sadie? <BR> Sadie? Oh well Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through uh through Grammy's brother George. Uh George was real sweet you know he had that thing. What is that thing where you uh where you uh fall asleep in the middle of a sentence you know-what is it? Uh... <BR> Uh narcolepsy. <BR> Narcolepsy right right. Right. So anyway so...  George uh went to the union see to get his free turkey be-because uh the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell-shocked you know what I mean in the First World War.  Anyway so so...  George is standing in line oh just a sec... uh getting his free turkey but the thing is he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So so...  so he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh dear. Well terrible huh wouldn't you say? I mean that's pretty unfortunate.
7669,I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs I think we got another rifle maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge. <BR> I got shells too box and a half tops.
7670,Maybe it's gone. <BR> They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.
7671,What the hell.  What is this?  A joke? <BR> No joke Lieutenant. <BR> Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...? <BR> Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can. <BR> If he was knocked out in the can how could be walking across the lobby?
7672,Because you paid for the breakfast I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't. <BR> Whatever. Just throw in your dollar and let's move.  See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants.
7673,You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention do you? Nah. You're like me. <BR> What the hell's the matter with you?
7674,"This is our honeymoon. <BR> After the wedding, which we're paying for ourselves, and this house..."
7675,Hi <BR> Hi.....  Roses. <BR> Yes.  And <BR> Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you? <BR> Sort of half..... <BR> Meaning? <BR> I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake. <BR> Honestly David you're so spineless.
7676,Well ... we'll leave her a note. <BR> I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.
7677,That's the oldest of the bunch looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one Junior in the cooler there. As we've seen what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed. <BR> And the rest of 'em? <BR> Unfortunately the worst of 'em are still outside.
7678,Gonna be some people at my house tonight.  Maybe you can make it. <BR> Where? <BR> Come with Tyler.  She knows.
7679,Is your family in the apple business too? <BR> No but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman. <BR> I've never seen a lobster. <BR> Really? <BR> I've never seen the ocean either.
7680,And the bookstore? Have you been working there long? <BR> It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation. <BR> Your dissertation? What subject do you study? <BR> American literature. What else? <BR> What else. Of course what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis? <BR> Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction. <BR> Wow. You don't fool around do you? <BR> Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre or the Ambiguities? <BR> Melville huh?  It's been a while. <BR> That's the subject of my last chapter. <BR> Not an easy book. <BR> Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
7681,Oh. Of course... sorry. <BR> My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been? <BR> Right... I was. I was an idiot plain and simple and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that? <BR> Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane... <BR> I have... did it sound that bad? <BR> Mmm-hmm. Listen I forgive you Mr. McCord... <BR> George... <BR> ...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime... <BR> Thanks... <BR> ...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
7682,Can't tell if you hear it or not. You hear it Tom? <BR> I hear it. I think they's some guys comin' this way lots of 'em. We better get outa here.
7683,No... Jason... please... <BR> I was here! <BR> ...it's not in the file... I swear... I know your file... your first job was Geneva!... I swear to God you never worked here!...
7684,Okay.   Okay.    I believe you. <BR> You killed her! <BR> No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place. <BR> Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you. <BR> You're fucked Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here. <BR> Look I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted. <BR> Where are the tapes? <BR> I can get them -- but what do I get if I do? <BR> A pass. <BR> A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene. <BR> Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you. <BR> They don't have a murder weapon? <BR> No. I have it. The lamp? The one with your fingerprints and her blood on it?  Remember?
7685,What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know Mark Ratner. <BR> Oh come on. What is he? Fifteen? <BR> Sixteen.
7686,I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay. <BR> It should taper off tomorrow but it can come back again. You have cramps?  They'll ease up almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy it's normal.
7687,How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone? <BR> You didn't say anything about my hair.
7688,My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years.  When was the last time you rode a bike? <BR> They say you never forget. <BR> Forget what? <BR> Forget how to ride a bike.
7689,And bring the cocktail shaker. <BR> Oh Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
7690,My husband's at the office. <BR> Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando. <BR> That's not his apartment. <BR> Anyway... I... the point is Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved but I am in business and believe me whoever set up your husband set me up. L.A.'s a small town people talk.
7691,Look--five men controlled that slush fund as CREEP--three of them we've got Mitchell Stans Magruder and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach. <BR> We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it.
7692,...but you're not -- you're not sure... <BR> We can't wait to be sure. <BR> I don't want to move again... I like it here. <BR> Look we clear out we get to the shack we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't -- <BR> -- where's left to go? -- <BR> -- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
7693,Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick but I need to do this. <BR> Do what? <BR> I gotta go. <BR> Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
7694,Strange. <BR> Think they're alright? <BR> Of course! I would've heard. <BR> How? <BR> I don't know for Christ's sake!
7695,Hello everybody.  I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne. <BR> I'm Josephine.  Sax.
7696,I told 'em not to touch the alarm. They touched it. I blew 'em full of holes. If they hadn't done what I told 'em not it they'd still be alive. <BR> That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage? <BR> I don't like alarms.
7697,I used to drive a taxi. <BR> Where you're going mister?
7698,According to what we've been able to verify you've been busy. <BR> I've got a lot of energy. <BR> Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story why not help? <BR> They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers. <BR> 
7699,What? What are you doing? <BR> What are you doing here?
7700,These people are serious Violet. If you want to know how serious ask Shelly.  They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules.  You fuck them you've got to do it right. <BR> That's why I need your help.  You said you were good. <BR> I am but ...
7701,You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible. <BR> What? Another letter from your friend? <BR> This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it. <BR> You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her? <BR> I sincerely doubt it. <BR> Give me the fucking letter.
7702,You have faith Professor Barnhardt <BR> It isn't faith that makes good science Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down please. I have several thousand questions to ask you. <BR> I would like to explain something of my mission here. <BR> That was my first question. <BR> It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets. <BR> Yes -- that is true. <BR> In the hands of a mature civilization these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies and we don't trust you with such power. <BR> If you mean that you are afraid of us-- <BR> We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That of course we cannot tolerate. <BR> These other planets -- do they have peace and security? <BR> We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then slowly we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos. <BR> We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission Mr. Klaatu? <BR> I came here to warn you that by threatening danger your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared however to offer a solution. <BR> Would you care to be more specific? <BR> What I have to say must be said to all concerned.  It is too important to be entrusted to any individual.
7703,"--this should take only a minute, Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in--  --and I was kind of curious about your check. <BR> ...check...? <BR> The twenty-five thousand dollar one.  The one with your name on it.  In Bernard Barker's Florida account.  Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar-- <BR> ...you're definitely doing a story...? <BR> Yes, sir. <BR> I'm a proper citizen, I'm a decent man, I don't do anything that isn't decent or proper.  I know I shouldn't tell you this..."
7704,No I'll tell it to you! For the last time I'll tell it to you. Because you've got to stop hurting yourself and me and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums! <BR> That word again! I don't even know what it means... <BR> It's time you found out. I love you.  I love you. You're a beautiful and intelligent woman-  - a beautiful and intelligent woman and a great actress-  - at the peak of her career. You have every reason for happiness-  - every reason but due to some strange uncontrollable unconscious drive you permit the slightest action of a kid-  - kid like Eve to turn you into a hysterical screaming harpy! Now once and for all stop it!
7705,I don't... seek publicity -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while? <BR> As far as I know. <BR> Good.  With any luck we'll run into each other.
7706,"Benjie! <BR> Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan? <BR> Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that! <BR> Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh? <BR> Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work? <BR> Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey. <BR> Yeah, good."
7707,A little? Sure I'll be right up.  He's all right. I like him. <BR> I'm glad.
7708,...worst possible time for me. <BR> A record of the arrests... <BR> I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance. <BR> That was nineteen years ago and they were simple gambling pinches. <BR> I mean if I can't work in Vegas where am I gonna go? <BR> You've been very open with us. I mean uh your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission. <BR> Well that's all I ask gentlemen a fair hearing.
7709,How much do you weigh? <BR> ... A hundred and eight?
7710,Murphy to Epps. <BR> Epps over. <BR> Either of you seen Dodge?
7711,Do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin playing just for the waitresses. <BR> You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job. <BR> So's working at McDonald's but you don't feel the need to tip them. They're servin' ya food you should tip em. But no society says tip these guys over here but not those guys over there. That's bullshit.
7712,That's a hell of a swing you got there Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime. <BR> Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three game six World Series.
7713,Oh boy -- can I Mom? <BR> Yes dear. Come on now.  Bobby your shoes are soaking! <BR> Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.
7714,"What do you do? Tell her you love her. <BR> But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address."
7715,What's goin' on? <BR> We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer -- <BR> Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -
7716,But last night... <BR> Who cares what I said last night James I -- I was drunk I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack? <BR> I'm sorry. <BR> And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years.
7717,It won't hold Ronnie it won't prove out. <BR> We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election. <BR> What would do that...? <BR> What in the <u>world</u> would do that? <BR> I'm working on it.
7718,He's right about the ear it's hacked off. <BR> Let me say this out loud just to get it straight in my mind. According to you Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back kill us grab the diamonds and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that right?
7719,Where? <BR> Just... I have to. <BR> And I want to know where. <BR> Please don't be angry... believe me it's got nothing to do with you. <BR> Where are you going? <BR> Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned the pieces off the flag. <BR> The Albacore Club. <BR> It has to do with my father. <BR> I know. <BR> He owns it. You know? <BR> I saw him. <BR> You saw my fa... father? When? <BR> This morning. <BR> You didn't tell me. <BR> There hasn't been a lot of time.
7720,Go sit next to him. <BR> Who? <BR> Mark Shale. <BR> Why? <BR> Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday. <BR> I don't watch him eat everyday. <BR> You stare at him non-stop like every lunch. Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents.
7721,That Silberman just crack me up.  He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first then set it on-- <BR> Shut up.
7722,That fucking figures... <BR> Should any of you decide to rush me I'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time.
7723,You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing at least that would be something but you don't. <BR> Yes sir.
7724,Maybe we oughta be going what do you think? <BR> Not without Leeloo.
7725,With all due respect Mr. Gekko what's to prevent you from doing the same thing? <BR> Cause I have a way around all this a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut.
7726,Rick this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich. <BR> How do you do Mr. Rick?
7727,...look Lieutenant...uh Vukovich don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department... <BR> I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah I know it...on Pico. Are you alright? <BR> Yes but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me. <BR> Alright Ms. Connor.  Listen carefully.  You're in a public place you'll be safe 'til we get there.  Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom.  I'll be there in a few minutes.
7728,This isn't '48 Dick.  They'll never buy it. <BR> How do you know that John?  Did we try?  Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em?  What's Hoover found for God's sake?
7729,They go. John. They go. <BR> What's wrong? <BR> They go. <BR> Of course. They go. Yes. Yes. <BR> They go.
7730,I got it!  I know what I got to do! I got to get the money. <BR> The money?  The money's gone. <BR> No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back. <BR> But it could be anywhere. <BR> He didn't have that much time.  He had to pick up Gino.  I bet you he's got it with him.  I bet it's in the car.
7731,Not supposed to talk about it. <BR> You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?
7732,Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards. <BR> I just want her to be happy. <BR> Same alarm clock every morning same two pops on the same snooze button...  Micheal Brenn. Yes...Yes...  Hold your horses. Okay. Got it. 6.321 at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at 3432.343.  Same shower towel toothbrush razor hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic Fisher and you better start addressing it. You're getting married and I'm not going to candy-coat it. It just gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body.
7733,Please don't make me say it again. <BR> No that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
7734,Oh Jesus put her on the monitor. Where's the pediatric code cart?  Odette give me that tube. All right flatline--let's do CPR. step back Frank. How many months? <BR> Can't tell. It was a breech twins. The other one seems okay though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity.
7735,Ah my fool is dead.  He was careless always.  Still I'll pull out your tongue for that.  Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors. <BR> Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert? <BR> What?
7736,Thanks again. For the dinner. <BR> Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook. <BR> I used to know how to cook. <BR> It's not like we're too busy.
7737,What do you think you're doing! <BR> Huh? <BR> The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out! <BR> Ohthe papers
7738,...done right you gotta do it yourself. <BR> Then do it the way you want.
7739,You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers. <BR> I feel different right now. <BR> You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero! <BR> I'm not going to marry anybody.
7740,Come on you can do better than that. Give him teeth - the whole personality. <BR> Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why? <BR> Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers. <BR> Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore? <BR> Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him. <BR> Oh no.  I'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy.
7741,Why?  Why would Johnnie do this? <BR> Jesus Christ Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
7742,- little things here and there it doesn't matter. You can be proud of yourself you've got a right to be. <BR> Are you proud of me Bill? <BR> I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts. <BR> You shouldn't have had any doubts. <BR> - after all the other day was one scene the woods are full of one scene sensations. But you did it. With work and patience you'll be a fine actress. If that's what you want to be. <BR> Is that what you want me to be? <BR> I'm talking about you. And what you want. <BR> So am I. <BR> What have I got to do with it? <BR> Everything. <BR> The names I've been called. But never Svengali.  Good luck.
7743,Want anything special for dinner? <BR> Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make? <BR> Okay.
7744,I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners -- <BR> You lived like this once. <BR> That is not now human! <BR> My name is Robert.
7745,Look I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy. <BR> Thanks David.  Always a pleasure.
7746,"You crying? <BR> I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know... <BR> Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was -- <BR> No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you -- <BR> You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did? <BR> I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children. <BR> Hell, I know. I -- I guess if you want to accuse me, you've got --  Oh hell! I've got to pick up Paul. I almost forgot."
7747,Oh my God...you're proposing? <BR> My life was totally crappy Herb and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me. <BR> ...In some weird way I respect that.
7748,They're all gone--or dead. <BR> They never wrote you nothing? <BR> No. They wasn't people to write.
7749,Gee -- those look like diamonds! <BR> Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out. <BR> Bet they're worth about a million dollars. <BR> Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them? <BR> Well sure but--
7750,Holy shit I don't believe it!  We've been going crazy over here Gino! <BR> Good boy.
7751,I object your Honor... <BR> Overruled... <BR> Exception! <BR> Noted. Thank you.  Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness. Her sole rebuttal was the document which has been disallowed...
7752,I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week. <BR> Nice to see you Senator. <BR> Help the Senator give him whatever he wants. <BR> Certainly.  Senator. <BR> Why not make them happy? <BR> We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.
7753,Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups. <BR> I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now we do. And things are different.
7754,I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me you could stop worrying... well for a while anyway. This is how I helped you right? <BR> Please... that's enough. I *loved* you too--you know I did. <BR>  <BR> Please don't... <BR> And now that Wally's coming back and because he'll certainly *need* you... <BR> You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
7755,Don't you like him? <BR> Yeah but I fucked up. You can take it. Really. <BR> Come on Stacy it's your section and your man. <BR> What should I do? <BR> Just take his order look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny laugh a lot.
7756,"How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States? <BR> That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying? <BR> To protect his people. <BR> I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him. <BR> Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you. <BR> John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard."
7757,Don't help me just get more napkins. And soda water. <BR> It was an accident. <BR> Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill. <BR> I said I was sorry...
7758,So what are you gonna do? <BR> About what? <BR>  <BR> About Calitri? No worries man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ... <BR> I can see that -
7759,Ah Mr. Van Orton.  Here you go... <BR> Have we met?
7760,"Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK? <BR> OK. <BR> I've come this far... here I am, in your house. I want you to let me pay the rent for this month. All right?"
7761,Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed. <BR> What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't. <BR> No there are variables that like I might not be good at. <BR> What variables? <BR> Like you know giving blow jobs. <BR> What's the big deal? <BR> Well I never did it. <BR> There's nothing to it.
7762,Frankie I want to ask you something. <BR> It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth. <BR> Of course Remo. <BR> I want you to tell me the truth mind you. <BR> I always tell you the truth Remo. <BR> Frankie... the little guy he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife would he? Because if he is... it's a problem. <BR> What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer I mean Nicky Ginger Ace all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed. <BR> Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business. <BR> So I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi I could wind up gettin' killed too. <BR> No. I ain't see anything like that. <BR> Are you sure? <BR> I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there you know? <BR> Yeah I know. That's why I'm asking. You see my main concern is Nicky. <BR> Hm. <BR> I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay. <BR> He's good. He's fine. <BR> I'm askin' you Frankie to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me. <BR> No problem. <BR> You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand? <BR> I understand. <BR> Okay.  Frankie you're a good boy.
7763,Honestly Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you? <BR> Gee I don't know Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room. <BR> Sometimes we have to improvise. <BR> Think Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean besides you and... me? <BR> James? My James? What's happened? <BR> Nothing he's just been sort of I don't know... kidnapped. <BR> Kidnapped? By who? <BR> His parents. <BR> Good God. Let's go rescue him. <BR> Good idea Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live. <BR> Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives. <BR> It's a little late to call Admissions. <BR> Is it a little late to call the Chancellor? <BR> Maybe... I don't know.
7764,This is for lawyers to talk about this concerns a run-of-the-play contract and this you can't rewrite or ad lib! <BR> Are you threatening me with legal action Mr. Fabian? <BR> Are you breaking the contract? <BR> Answer my question! <BR> Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man. <BR> I didn't hear you. <BR> I said I'm a dying man! <BR> Not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill!
7765,...rings a bell somewhere. So what? <BR> A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots flies northeast Canada some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities... <BR> ...don't like airlines lousy unions... <BR> There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
7766,All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right? <BR> No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
7767,It wasn't what I wanted. <BR> So what did you want? I think we understand each other no? <BR> You don't understand me. <BR> You don't understand you either.
7768,Some little kid stole the hubcaps. <BR> The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going Mr. Lazzaro? <BR> Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere. <BR> Might be an accident on the West Side Highway. <BR> How come you got the kid with you? <BR> Matthew's my grandson. <BR> A grandmother. God bless you. <BR> He does bless me each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before. <BR> It's the kid's lucky day. <BR> This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming. <BR> Now that's a complicated subject. <BR> That's a simple subject. <BR> Look we're stuck here front and back. It's dinnertime for you game time for me. Let's park the cab and go to Mannion's. What do you say Matthew? We'll drink beer and talk baseball.
7769,Dude that movie was fucking sweet! <BR> You bet your fucking ass it was!
7770,No thank you. It's my problem too. <BR> I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning. <BR> Yes. <BR> This is Lila Crane from Phoenix. She's been here for a few days looking for her sister. There's a private detective helping... and well we got a call tonight from this detective saying he'd traced Mary...
7771,That was a really shitty thing to do. <BR> I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
7772,They don't go for the vault? <BR> Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy. <BR> Smart.  You burn time in the vault. <BR> Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car they leave it running at the curb looks parked from a distance.  When they run they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish.
7773,Anne come here. Listen <BR> Look out for my lipstick Stewart. <BR> I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves <BR> Are you crazy? <BR> Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that? <BR> Will you stop being silly Stewart? <BR> I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that? <BR> But I don't want to meet your gang. <BR> I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile. <BR> Meaning my friends aren't worthwhile I suppose? <BR> Oh they're all right Anne. But I <BR> That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you and what you're going to do.
7774,Mm. <BR> Fuckin' Jews stick together don't they? <BR> They're havin' a good time too. <BR> So are we.
7775,Over here.  I want you to meet somebody. <BR> Lucky.  Lucky lucky lucky.
7776,Really? <BR> From a rich millionaire. <BR> That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine. <BR> Me? <BR> Daphne has a beau - I have a beau - if we could only find somebody for you.
7777,He's broken his pattern. <BR> They've broken their pattern. <BR> You're sure about this two person thing? <BR> Broad daylight a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
7778,We do the show live in front of an audience. <BR> Great but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny. <BR> Yeah well that's why this machine is dynamite.
7779,M'm that was so nice. That was nice. <BR> As Balzac said... <BR> H'm? <BR>  <BR> Oh yeah? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Yeah? <BR> Yeah I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck. <BR> No.  You're a wreck. <BR> Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again. <BR> You're really nuts. I don't know you really thought it was good? Tell me. <BR> Good? I was- <BR> No. <BR> No that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing. <BR> Here you want some? <BR> No no I-I-i uh I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and <BR> Yeah? <BR> I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear. <BR> Oh I don't know I don't really. I don't do it very often you know just sort of er... relaxes me at first. <BR> M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this but- <BR> What? What?
7780,Uh huh. <BR> She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
7781,Is this the same stuff you made last week? <BR> No no it's different. <BR> I hope it tastes better than the other stuff. <BR> It tastes different. <BR> I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey!
7782,We'll try again. <BR> No way. I've got to get out now.
7783,My daddy lets me sit on his lap. <BR> Does he? <BR> Yes. <BR> Do you like it when he asks you?
7784,Yeah I know they'll hate me immediately.  Thank you. <BR> No I don't think so. No I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary I think- <BR> Yeah. <BR> It's Easter. You know we'll have a nice dinner we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.
7785,Been doin' a job? <BR> Yeah. <BR> I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade? <BR> Why don't you get to it buddy? <BR> Get to what? <BR> You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been? <BR> I don't stick my nose in nobody's business. <BR> Naw--not much! <BR> I stay in my own yard. <BR> Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else? <BR> You ain't got to get sore. <BR> Go ahead. Ask me anything you want. <BR> I didn't mean nothing. <BR> Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around that's all.  See that road up ahead? <BR> Yeah. <BR> That's where I get off.
7786,Buddy buddy when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short. <BR> Hello Natalie -- guess who? That's right and you know everyday I say to myself today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko? <BR> It concerns his future! <BR> Of course he's busy and so am I. Five minutes. That's all I'm asking. I know that if he could only hear what I have to say... it would change his life.
7787,He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it. <BR> I never touched your father! I swear!
7788,You got the message Lecktor called... <BR> I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes. <BR> From the lip wound which happened seven hours before he got burned we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning. <BR> What's it narrow down to? <BR> Milwaukee Madison Dubuque Peoria St. Louis Indianapolis Cincinnati Toledo and Detroit. <BR> That's narrow? <BR> When are you coming back? <BR> When I'm done.
7789,Okay thank you for asking. <BR> She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money. <BR> Hello.
7790,Two hundred. <BR> Two hundred pounds? <BR> Two hundred pounds. <BR> You paid two hundred pounds for this? <BR> That's what it cost David. <BR> No no no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet for you two to have a good time we don't know the cost of that yet.
7791, <BR> Starling - <BR> That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin so that - <BR> Starling we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now. <BR> Where?
7792,You're the one who doesn't care Phil. <BR> It hurts too much to care. <BR> About yourself? <BR> About anything.
7793,Asian studies at Langley said the mark you found on the tree is a Chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling. The character also appears on a mah- jongg piece.  It means Red Dragon.  That mean anything to you? <BR> No.
7794,I wish you could see the world as I do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no turning back from that. <BR> I don't believe that. <BR> You will. Time is on our side. Sooner or later the Thirst always wins.
7795,Tell me honestly since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money? <BR> On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen! <BR> Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet. <BR> Oh shit.  Take your time!  Don't get suckered!  This man is a murderer!  In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.  Please just take the fall!
7796,I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it. <BR> For what?
7797,Well...?  Shall we go? <BR> Not yet. <BR> The English won't wait.
7798,C'mon on this way. <BR> I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run!
7799,So how long you've been living here? <BR> Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there? <BR> Yeah.
7800,I have the White House on the Line. <BR> ...one minute:  Demille needs an elephant for a reshoot.
7801,No see I don't need a finder's fee I need - finder's fee's what ten percent heck that's not gonna do it for me. I need the principal. <BR> Jerry we're not just going to give you seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
7802,Look you dont tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Whos the guy? The Austrian? <BR> Whos the guy? Whos the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate Id have had to kill him.
7803,Regarding what? <BR> Does she sound pissed scared hostile? Did she mention the police? <BR> No but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right.
7804,If you must know it's a hectic time for Tony. The Grammys are tonight. <BR> The what? <BR> The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards. <BR> You mean they give awards for that kind o' music? <BR> Oh! <BR> I thought just earplugs.
7805,It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it? <BR> Yes... <BR> That's not what happened to your parents. <BR> Then what? <BR> I killed them.
7806,What the fuck's going on? <BR> Dude get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do. <BR> Yeah I know how you do. I know how you do. I've heard your kibbles and bits all fucking night. You've been shaking your ass like an unemployed clown. How the room's a boiling pot of sugar water. How you're gonna dip a string into it and make rockcandy. Who wants to play 'Just the tip?' Dancing around like a smacked ass. Oh and that coat check girl you've been dragging around as 'insurance' doesn't even speak English. 
7807,Don't try to talk -- <BR> Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back. <BR> No we can treat the wounds --
7808,Watch out for that one. She's got a great average but she's looking for a prince. And believe me she's  <BR> kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf. <BR> Putt-putt golf?
7809,My dear Aulon to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood! <BR> Majesty I can't... <BR> Why are you not ready to die for your king? <BR> Of course I am it's just that... <BR> Good.  Until then feel free to live like a king!
7810,If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die. <BR> Coming from you that's quite a compliment. <BR> <i>De nada</i>. Now come here...bend over...before I change my mind. <BR> Bend over?
7811,Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing. <BR> Ace got my son little Nicky involved with Little League and it was great. <BR> Now I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game. <BR> Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'... <BR> Now go out there and show your dad what you can do. <BR> ...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean it was all about the kids you know. <BR> You know he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does. <BR> Yeah well that's exactly what I keep tellin' him but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born. <BR> It's instinctive you know. <BR> He tries to do everything...
7812,Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does.. <BR> Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
7813,Where we going? <BR> Quick drop. In and out. <BR> Where's Ricky? <BR> Ricky's taken care of. <BR> How so? <BR> He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there. <BR> That it? <BR> That's it.
7814,No. It's Bob's Photo Store in... <BR> Have him peel the top label back. <BR> See if there's another label underneath.
7815,Gosh no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara blush floral-print dresses? <BR> Deodorant.
7816,Tomorrow Gordon. <BR> Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
7817,Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel? <BR> No no I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like it would be really great if nobody hit me. <BR> What have you done Junebug? Did you hit someone with the Previa?
7818,I think you better tell us. <BR> We don't even know you. <BR> Well we're FBI agents. <BR> You're not FBI agents.
7819,Hello. <BR> Chloe? <BR> Uncle Bobby? <BR> Hi baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy? <BR> I don't know. <BR> Mommy's not home? <BR> No. <BR> What time is it there? <BR> Can you take me to Color Me Mine? <BR> Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.
7820,Faith this is my mother. <BR> Oh hello. <BR> Mommy this is Faith.
7821,You're really something Coco...thank you. <BR> Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
7822,Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time too! <BR> We're running out of smoke.
7823,You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there... <BR> My dad used to be in the Army but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
7824,Yes. <BR> She ain't missing so much as she's run away.
7825,In English.   Sami doesn't speak French. <BR> Where are you from?
7826,...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth back and forth. <BR> You are right. What can I...
7827,Just what the hell do you think you're doing?! <BR> I don't know what you're talking about? <BR> I think you know. <BR> Maybe you can tell me then.
7828,You seem surprised. Could it be you dont think that badly of him after all?  You neednt worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse. <BR> What... What are you talking about? <BR> Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You dont mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is hes either on the run held captive or dead.  I understand your misgivings Mrs De Moraes. But Ive seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why Im here at such a late hour. I need Ł20000 in cash by 11 this morning. <BR> Excuse me? <BR> I need the money to smooth my way you understand? Now have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning?
7829,Thats right. <BR> Will you please come with me? <BR> That might depend on where youre going. <BR> I am Lawrence sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes majordomo. They are expecting you. <BR> De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz. <BR> That would be Mrs De Moraes mother Sir. Mr and Mrs Spitz are here with their daughter.
7830,I don't know. <BR> Don't go. <BR> I have to... he's a G-34 <BR> You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report. <BR> No don't make trouble.  It's nothing.
7831,What we want to know about is Manchester. <BR> Yes Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know.
7832,Oh honey I didn't mean to scare you. <BR> How did you come in here? <BR> Well my wife Ester's down the hall. I saw Barnett leaving and I was just talking to Ester about your being here.
7833,Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape? <BR> I don't know. I can't really tell from here. <BR> He is.
7834,Ladies and gentlemen last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now. <BR> Damn!
7835,The phone's dead. <BR> Really? <BR> Do you know how to change a tire? <BR> No.  Do you?  Can't be too hard can it?  I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.
7836,... looks like you grown another inch... but you don't look so hot getting bags under your eyes starting to look old like me. <BR> Ah I had a tough day. Some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss. <BR> Speak English will ya. <BR> D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me. <BR> I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer <BR> Coulda been a contender. <BR> you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman. <BR> Look Dad I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm. <BR> You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money right? You're a salesman. <BR> Dad it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline. <BR> I don't get it you get a scholarship to NYU you get 35000 the first year and 50 last year where the hell is it? <BR> 50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple Dad not any more. I pay 40% in taxes I got a rent of 15000 I got school loans car loans food park my car costs me 3 bills a month I need good suits that's $500 a pop shoes... <BR> So come home and live rent free 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50000 Jesus Christ the world is off its rocker. I made $37000 last year and you... <BR> It's Queens Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me you'll see...  <BR> It's yourself you've got to be proud of Huckleberry how much ya need? <BR> Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month promise.
7837,Ah! Thank you Joe.  Tell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties you know. Gee we haven't had one of those in a long time have we Gallagher? <BR> Not since you broke into society. <BR> Remember the time we had a spaghetti party and while I was serving the spaghetti I dropped it on the floor and while those mugs weren't looking I picked it up and served it to them anyway! Remember that? Yes Anne would love that.
7838,Deleon. <BR> Satch you gotta listen to me... <BR> Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard. <BR> No kidding.  I'm on the corner of 65th and CPW.  Come get me.

7840,He tried to kill her first. <BR> Is Sid in therapy?
7841,I know what you are feeling.  But this is not productive -- <BR> He was my only brother...my only family!  I want blood for my blood.  We search...now.
7842,I see. And when was this unholy alliance joined? <BR> We decided the night before last before we came up here... <BR> Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers gypsy violins off stage? <BR> The setting wasn't romantic but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning banging on my door - he couldn't sleep he told me - he's left Karen he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home... <BR> You sat and talked until it was light... <BR> We sat and talked Addison. I want a run of the play contract. <BR> There never was there'll never be another like you. <BR> Well say something - anything! Congratulations skol - good work Eve!
7843,What did he say? Tell me! <BR> He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry. <BR> What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ? <BR> He wants money. <BR> Tell him to put the kettle down and I'll give him money.
7844,Elementary Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ... <BR> Very good Steed ...
7845,Love and happiness for ever. <BR> For ever and ever.
7846,So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day. <BR> You think so? Joyce says she's timid. <BR> Joyce was screwing Del. <BR> ...among others. <BR> I'd say that about torches her credibility wouldn't you? <BR> Yeah well if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur just like Del was.
7847,So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time? <BR> It's been a pretty lonely couple of years. <BR> I'm sorry. <BR> Well it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry. <BR> Oh sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and -- <BR> I miss you. <BR> Miss you too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while. <BR> Oh! Great. That's great! <BR> A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy. <BR> I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have -- <BR> I'm glad you called.

7851,I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited... <BR> That little prick. <BR> Then I called his house and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father. <BR> That little prick. <BR> I paid for it and everything. <BR> There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this. <BR> Don't do anything Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy. <BR> Stacy he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
7852,It's Maria Portos. What should we do? <BR> Why don't you try letting her in Steve  I mean Shenge. <BR> Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it! <BR> Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money they don't have respect for you.
7853,I gotta get something I gotta get ...shoes?  Ties? Hats...?  Good.  Good.  <BR> ...what is this?
7854,I never read that. That was-that was Henry James right? Novel uh the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual... <BR> It's the influence of television. Yeah now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high uh high intensity you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a... <BR> What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure. <BR> ...as opposed to a print...
7855,You want me to put it all in writing? Over my signature? <BR> Nobody knows more about this thing than you do John.
7856,I'll talk to you tomorrow. <BR> That's what you said before. <BR> I know. Goodbye.
7857,We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been <u>sleeping</u> down here.  We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  I'd rethink that. <BR> I want a second opinion. <BR> <u>This is an operations desk</u>. <BR> I'm not asking.
7858,What's going on here? <BR> You'll find out - soon enough.
7859,Mike! You have a mess on C-9! <BR> All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break. <BR> Get going.
7860,You know how you sound Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny for good or for evil. <BR> Yes I get the point.
7861,We're hung up here.  Snagged. <BR> Can you get us a line?
7862,Oh come on Buzz.  I...Buzz I can't do this without you.  I need your help. <BR> I can't help.  I can't help anyone. <BR> Why sure you can Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you and we'll make a break for Andy's house. <BR> Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference. <BR> Oh Buzz you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly. <BR> No Woody for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy. <BR> Whoa hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger. <BR> Yeah right. <BR> No it is.  Look over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest and it's not because you're a Space Ranger pal it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy. <BR> But why would Andy want me? <BR> Why would Andy want you?!  Look at you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.  You've got wings you glow in the dark you talk your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.
7863,Oh man...what happened? <BR> I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on. <BR> Alright...alright...you've saved my ass enough times.  What do you want to do?
7864,Annette how long have we known each other? <BR> Forever. <BR> Now it's my job to look out for you. You're like a kid sister to me. Do I look like some kind of gossip queen?
7865,Ray... <BR> Mister Tully. <BR> Do you want a coffee? <BR> No. No no. Thank you.
7866,Immortality. <BR> Spirits have a way of bringing that out. <BR> And being sixteen. <BR> They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing... <BR> What's that? <BR> They'll know about it in the morning.
7867,Come on. Come swimmin' with us. <BR> Right now? <BR> Yeah. Come on. <BR> Hold on.
7868,Not bad.  What for? <BR> That's none of your goddamn business Caesar. <BR> You're right.  You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.  I just hope you understand you're among good people here.
7869,We've got to have a talk you and me. <BR> All right but later. I've got a meeting now. <BR> A meeting? <BR> Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
7870,"Mulder -- it's me -- <BR> Where are you, Scully? <BR> I'm on the roof. <BR> Did you find something? <BR> No. I haven't. <BR> What's wrong, Scully? <BR> I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here. <BR> You're looking for a bomb. <BR> I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street. <BR> I think they have that covered. <BR> Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. If we don't act in accordance with that data -- if you ignore it as we have done -- the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. Lives could be lost --"
7871,Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action. <BR> Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
7872,How about a Big Mac? <BR> Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you. <BR> C'mon we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite.

7874,Good wages eh! Pickin' oranges an' peaches? <BR> We gonna take whatever they got.
7875,"Well, well. All my family together again. How very sweet. <BR> Julia. <BR> Frank. <BR> I knew you'd come. <BR> You knew? <BR> Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises. <BR> Oh, I do. I do."
7876,Damn him!  I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that. <BR> You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands. <BR> What have I got now?  It's exactly as if there were two emperors. Because of this the people have two minds.  He is their champion.
7877,One hundred and twenty-seven. <BR> How much do you think you'll need? <BR> First offense burglary --  -- probably two-fifty.  The piggy bank.
7878,You through Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one. <BR> Well what're your ideas on these guys? <BR> Forget about it kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau right? <BR> So you're gonna coast to retirement when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity. <BR> You watch your fucking mouth!  Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal of Honor right here!
7879,And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them? <BR> Oh yes I play with them... lots...

7881,So this is what a test? <BR> Call it a reckoning of character.
7882,Harbor Air do you read?  Over? <BR> Brody?  This is Patrol Base.

7884,Do you think she'll be all right? <BR> She knows how to take care of herself.
7885,Amazing how? <BR> She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted! <BR> Well in all likelihood she's completely guilty as well. She was seen standing over her husband's dead body.
7886,Is this enough? <BR> Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
7887,"Why are you telling me this? <BR> I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked. <BR> What happened to Kurtzweil? <BR> As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future. <BR> Where is he? <BR> Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk."
7888,Are you okay?  You just face planted! <BR> I know how it feels to be dead.
7889,You know this guy? <BR> His names Horrace. Horrace this is Ricky Slade.
7890,Ilsa I -- <BR> -- Yes? <BR> When I was in the concentration camp were you lonely in Paris?
7891,No no no.  Put it back on and take it off slowly. <BR> Jesus what kinda broad are you? <BR> When you know how to make love you'll know how to pitch.  Shh.  I love this part.
7892,Didn't see the war.  I was born after in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's. <BR> The what? <BR> Hunter Killers.  Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up put in camps...for orderly disposal.
7893,Let's hear the five 'F's' for today.  F for... <BR> Farley! <BR> F for... <BR> Flavors! <BR> F for... <BR> Fabulous! <BR> F for... <BR> Fast! <BR> F for... <BR> Foods!
7894,It will it just hasn't bottomed out yet give it time. <BR> Ben Jesus there are over two thousand reporters in this town are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
7895,No. <BR> Moreover the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company... <BR> Not too quickly. <BR> What? <BR> You're a little too fast. <BR> Can't you understand me? <BR> I understand you perfectly. <BR> Have you got it now? <BR> Cotton Company -- <BR> Should throw a great weight into the balance... <BR> ...weight into the balance...
7896,Strategy. <BR> Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school. <BR> The Big Picture. <BR> That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough. <BR> So change it.
7897,Well I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to. <BR> I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on sit down. <BR> Thank you.  My my! Scrambled eggs. <BR> Egg. One eggdoughnutsblack coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints? <BR> Nope. No complaints. <BR> I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint. <BR> Why you don't have to apologize Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this. <BR> What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning? <BR> Must be the Spring. <BR>  <BR> He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married. <BR> Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut? <BR> Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly don't you? I mean running away and everything. <BR> No. No. It's too good a story. <BR> Yes you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man! <BR> Yeah? <BR> It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken. <BR> Um. You're doing all right. <BR> Thanks. Nurses governesses chaperones even body-guards. Oh it's been a lot of fun. <BR> One consolation; you can never be lonesome. <BR> It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. II did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it? <BR> Santa Claus? <BR> KingKing Westley was in it. <BR> Oh. Is that how you met him? <BR> Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged.  <BR> Say where did you learn to dunk in finishing school? <BR> Aw now don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk. <BR> Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop into your mouth. If you let it soak so long it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it. <BR> Thanks professor. <BR> Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk. <BR> I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day.
7898,Okay. Hi. <BR> So who's the lucky guy? <BR> Who? <BR> The groom?
7899,Nope. <BR> Well you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace? <BR> Yep. <BR> Anyone else residing there? <BR> Nope. <BR> Well Mr. Proudfoot this call came in past three in the morning.  It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.
7900,This better be the real thing or you're a dead man! <BR> It is I'm telling you it is!! <BR> You've told me a lot of things boyo...
7901,Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers DOD whatever they got. Snipers? <BR> Hold on -- he said he wants to come in. <BR> My ass he does. You're playing with fire Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that but I don't think he meant repatriate him. <BR> Don't you want answers? <BR> There are no answers. There's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead. And I for one would prefer the latter. And what about her?  You just send her out to this lunatic with no protection?
7902,Mikey? <BR> Yeah? <BR> Geometry? <BR> Sure anything but this English.
7903,Yeah Billy who's your buyer?... No not interested.  Ollie start calling a the institutions start with Marx at Janson Mutual then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money baby! And we're on our way! <BR> You got it G.G.
7904,Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it. <BR> I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments. <BR> Then say it. <BR> Life is good. <BR> Speak it like it's real. Matthew.
7905,I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done. <BR> This is how we've managed to last. <BR> We're able to surprise each other. <BR> In and out of bed. <BR> Because we're completely mismatched. <BR> We don't even like each other do we?
7906,I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans? <BR> Tonight? <BR> Any night. <BR> Well not exactly... <BR> Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
7907,You don't talk to me like that. <BR> I apologized I offered to help. <BR> Clean out your locker. <BR> Fine Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week. <BR> I'll be right with you.
7908,GOT THE HOT FLUSH SYMPTOMS AND I'M FEELING FREAKY <BR> YOUNG MALE INTERN TALL AND HANDSOME <BR> GOT MY HEM SO HIGH THEY'LL SAY I'M BEING CHEEKY <BR> WITH LEGS LIKE MINE I'M REALLY MADE FOR DANCING
7909,We have just folded space from Ix... <BR> Yes?... How was your journey? <BR> Many machines on Ix... new machines. <BR> Oh yes? -- NAVIGATOR Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans.
7910,What did I tell you? What? What did I tell you? <BR> I don't know. What -- ?
7911,It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that. <BR> You killed them.
7912,Peter I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten. <BR> Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted contrary to rumour you're still in one piece? <BR> What rumour? <BR> That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know ridiculous.
7913,I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright? <BR> Fine. <BR> What will you do? <BR> There's nothing I can do.  I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon.
7914,Whadda you want! <BR> If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat. <BR> Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on young feller.  <BR> Just between you and me I never intended taking it off.
7915,This is a daily paper we'll explain it tomorrow.  You're certain on Mitchell? <BR> He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General--
7916,...go on go on... <BR> That's everything Bachinski had I think it's worth following up. <BR> Don't know; who the hell's Howard Hunt?  It's probably nothing but check it out. Just go easy it could be crazy Cubans.
7917,Huh. <BR> Talk about dumb luck.  Odds of anybody finding that girl thirty years later. And then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it.  Bets part is she's the first victim.  She knew the doer.  I'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking.
7918,What is it mother? <BR> I wish to discuss your brother. <BR> He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss. <BR> First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive but well cared for in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner. <BR> I am King Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you. <BR> He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him. <BR> Why would you ask now?  You never asked before! <BR> Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away but as a man. <BR> You have prayed too much.  Your mind is weak.
7919,I'm sorry -- <BR> -- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
7920,A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year. <BR> It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you Christy.
7921,A User -- in our world? <BR> Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
7922,Give it more morphine! <BR> We'll kill it with too much we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm almost done.  Damn it I need another adhesive something pliable I can --
7923,Why don't you help me? <BR> Because I don't have time. <BR> Why not? <BR> I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it. <BR> And how do you know that? <BR> Because of the future. I know what's going to happen. <BR> William that is just another facet of my delusions.
7924,Take all the time you like doctor. <BR> I'm sorry I've never seen any of them. <BR> Look again if you like.
7925,Your place? <BR> Yeah. Oh it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here but 'twill serve m'lady 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids. <BR> Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house <BR> When 'we' . . .?  You mean you'd like to have me live here in your house?
7926,You know you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice. <BR> He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
7927,And I looked at her and thought to myself Oh my god this girl is a baby. <BR> Yeah. <BR> And for a second I felt a little bit guilty. You know because she's young and all. And then I was like oh shit that turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl.
7928,Um Paul. On second thought can you do me a favor and pretend I never said any of that. <BR> Sure dad. <BR> Thanks.
7929,Murdered?  Why? <BR> There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women all nurses between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped. <BR> What kinda twisted animal. <BR> Dad we did something.  Something to make it worse. <BR> Whatta you mean... <BR> He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten. <BR> What are you talking about? <BR> Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy this Nightingale guy he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women. <BR> I gotta take her away John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away. <BR> I don't know...  What about the other women? <BR> I'll warn them. <BR> That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy. <BR> What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is. <BR> No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it. <BR> So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me? <BR> They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment. <BR> I don't know John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different. <BR> I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
7930,What's that? <BR> All right Vader's boss... <BR> The Emperor. <BR> Right the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure yes? <BR> How do you mean? <BR> Well he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman kind of albeit an evil one. <BR> I guess. <BR> Now he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule. <BR> Yeah. <BR> Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion. <BR> It would stand to reason yes. <BR> Hence the Empire was a fascist theocracy and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution. <BR> More or less. <BR> The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief. <BR> I think they were Catholics.
7931,As bizarre as it may sound seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight. <BR> No? <BR> Should we close down any eruption? <BR> Are you sure? <BR> We're seeing all the signs in town. <BR> I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
7932,Hey I'm cruisin' man--what're you doing out here?! <BR> I want you to throw this one at the bat rack. <BR> Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to. <BR> It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me. <BR> You're the boss.
7933,But I didn't open it! I didn't! <BR> Then why are you here? <BR> I've come for my father!
7934,Goddamnit-- <BR> --shit-- <BR> --we gotta top the Times-- <BR> --I know I know-- <BR> --if we could name the guys got the reports we'd be ahead again-- <BR> --shit who do we know?-- <BR> --I know a lawyer at Justice-- <BR> --has he got an ax?-- <BR> --almost every source we've used has been Republican this guy's a card- carrying Democrat. <BR> Then he's got an ax.  Call him anyway.
7935,Jillie you want a cheese grilled sandwich? <BR> It's called a grilled cheese sandwich you dub.
7936,You do have a vivid imagination Mr Lombard. I only wish youd use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still say what youre owed if you still wish to be paid or get out all right? <BR> I guess the news youd sent me after Friedman didnt go down too well eh?
7937,So I enjoyed meeting you. <BR> You'll call me right? <BR> Yeah. <BR> When? <BR> Tomorrow? <BR> Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all. <BR> Okay.
7938,How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop?  Tell it to the U.S. Attorney Lounds! <BR> What is it?
7939,Say you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife. <BR> Thank you sir. <BR> But not for me!  Though I like you well enough. You're a nice fellow. You're all right. But I'm sorry I don't need any valleys today.
7940,The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice. <BR> Choice?  What kind of choice? <BR> Whether or not you're willing to play Nancy one last time.
7941,She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school.  All year.  She didn't even go to the prom. <BR> I heard she got straight A's.
7942,JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY! <BR> If he doesn't shut up...
7943,That little black line? <BR> That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.
7944,Just look at this mess I got to deal with. <BR> What are you going to do with it? <BR> I told them to run it through the cycles.  But I guess Gino has plans for it because he's coming here tomorrow night to pick this shit up.
7945,I hope you don't mind that I took so long to finish. <BR> Oh no no don't be... tsch... don't be silly. You know  I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now. <BR> Oh sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience. <BR> Oh tsch thank you. H'm. <BR> I mean that as a compliment. <BR> I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm you know to make up for empty areas in life. <BR> Who said that? <BR> Uh oh I don't know. It might have been Leopold and Loeb.  Hello. Oh hi... Uh no what-what's the matter? What-what-what? You sound terrible... No what- Sure I- Whatta yuh what kind of an emergency?... No well stay there. Stay there I'll come over right now. I'll come over right now.  Just stay there I'll come right over.
7946,Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call? <BR> No. <BR> Why not? <BR> The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago... <BR> And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors. <BR> You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore Jack. <BR> Last two like this we had you caught. <BR> That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing. <BR> That's not entirely true Will. It's the way you think. <BR> I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that. <BR> You look all right now. <BR> I am all right.
7947,I told you he was a sore. <BR> Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet and he says bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story. <BR> Here's a wow.
7948,...what kinda car's Jasmine drive? <BR> Ahh Mercedes I think. Black. <BR> Yeah? The sport utility? <BR> Uh-huh. <BR> Damn that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person? <BR> Better. <BR> Oh fuck...
7949,Hey!  Wow! <BR> What?  What is it? <BR> Woody!  Buzz! <BR> Oh great you found them.  Where were they? <BR> Here!  In the car! <BR> See?  Now what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
7950,Is everything okay? <BR> Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies. <BR> But somebody wrote those songs. <BR> So what's your point? <BR> Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all. <BR> No Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
7951,Oh yes. <BR> Whistler was a great painter but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
7952,The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So -- <BR> Look I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures. <BR> All right I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours. <BR> How do I know you won't keep them all? <BR> I'll take you with me.
7953,Head for the roof! <BR> I have to find Kelly! <BR> I think she's with Sarah! <BR> DAMN IT BE SURE!!
7954,They'll get us on accesory to murder. <BR> Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops you explain it was an accident...
7955,Sorry Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight. <BR> Jesus. <BR> Hell. It's been four days!
7956,Are you alright Wade? <BR> Yeah sure. Why? I got this damned tooth I got a few things bugging me like everybody else. But I'm okay. <BR> Well you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral. <BR> Alma I think there's some dirty business going on in this town. <BR> Always has been. <BR> This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about I'm talking about murder. Among other things. <BR> Who? <BR> Evan Twombley the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him. <BR> Who? <BR> You know Jack Hewitt the kid I work with?
7957,"Wanna play some tennis Saturday? <BR> You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client... <BR> ...you take that Anacott Steel? <BR> ...light snack, but good, thanks pal, you're sharking your way up..."
7958,Martin!  Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority? <BR> Do I need any more authority?
7959,...come on sport you gotta try harder I need some exercise for chrissake... <BR> Mr. Gekko I don't think I can...go on. <BR> ...finish out the game Bud push yourself...
7960,I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace. <BR> Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way. <BR> We can have it altered. <BR> Oh no you don't!  Look Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all. <BR> Why not? <BR> Well to begin with I'm not a natural blonde. <BR> It doesn't matter. <BR> And I smoke. I smoke all the time. <BR> I don't care. <BR> And I have a terrible past.  For three years now I've been living with a saxophone player. <BR> I forgive you. <BR> And I can never have children. <BR> We'll adopt some. <BR> But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN! <BR> Well - nobody's perfect.
7961,Say take it easy! Take it easy! Listen my boy. No use you hanging around here. Just buy the Tribune tonight and read all about it. You can rewrite it for your last edition. <BR> Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English. <BR> Oh is that so? <BR> I'm afraid.
7962,There's got to be a flashlight. <BR> I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
7963,Stick with Carla. <BR> Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years Bill.  We've lived together six years.
7964,Hi.  My wonderful junk yard. The mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard- <BR> Heaven help me I love a psychotic.
7965,I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean this is family it ain't business. Meanwhile you make calls back home. Sammy it makes us look bad out here you know what I mean? Back and forth this one and that one and in the meantime she's gone anyway. Am I right? <BR> I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy. <BR> I think if you uh okay it you know assure her that she's gonna be all right she'll come back. <BR> She's driving me fuckin' crazy. <BR> Well once you get her here you think about it you know?  But get the kid back here. She wants to come back. That's the uh that's the main thing here. You want your kid don't you? Huh?
7966,I thought you'd never ask. The older one is Janet she's nine and the younger one is Morgan. <BR> Oh now he's adorable. <BR> He's three now. Course not in that picture. <BR> Oh he's adorable. <BR> Yah he - <BR> Where'd you get him that parka?
7967,Krueger... doesn't ring a bell. <BR> He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades. <BR> Fascinating. <BR> Now.... according to the file Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984 there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's.
7968,So. Are we ready? <BR> Ready. Any time you are. <BR> I'm all ears. <BR> Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far? <BR> Every word. <BR> Okay.  So this is the story of how it happened.  Okay.  It was the summer of 'seventy-six back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial.  A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then so I didn't see him at first....
7969,What... are you? <BR> Are we so strange?  So alien to you?  I've seen this culture the wealth the greed the waste... it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect place to spread my empire.  Honestly Eastern Europe was so dead the Communists just drained the blood out of the place.  It's livened up a bit in the past few years but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption.  The city of Angels.
7970,Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week. <BR> It's one thing for kids. You get older you Nhave other things. <BR> It's all connected Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later they sit in the kitchen and remember. <BR> But the son is suppose to stop crying. <BR> I could have grown up happy. A Yankee fan. A divorce lawyer.
7971,Boss! Jesus! They've -- <BR> They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!
7972,No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said Adam he said...He told me and I heard him... he said...  Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake. <BR> Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said first of all I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father. <BR> Are you solid with that? <BR> No. I think it's fucked. <BR> Then fuck what your father said cause I'm gonna tell you right now...You'll know what it's all about why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here?
7973,But don't worry man. Things are all sweetness and light here... <BR> Things are all leafy and suburban ...
7974,Yes an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right Mr. Benjamin? <BR> Absolutely. We would be honored.
7975,Chicken is a fool's game captain. <BR> So is violating international law. <BR> But you invited is aboard. <BR> Your cannons made a compelling argument.
7976,What am I doing here? <BR> You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate. <BR> Penetration but not perforation.
7977,What's wrong? <BR> Ooohh nothing.  I just got fired that's all.
7978,Good morning Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night. <BR> I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night? <BR> Oh the usual thing. Blah blah blah attended the blah blah reception and wore the same blah blah things. <BR> Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to. <BR> You don't have anything to complain about Mother. He was all right last night wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him. <BR> It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
7979,No I don't think that at all.  How is he? <BR> They wouldn't let me...
7980,Brad!  Oh Brad. <BR> He's a lame dog remember?  But even he wouldn't want to see you like this.
7981,May I ask where youre from Mr Lamont? <BR> Europe...  France. Im French but I live in London...  ... England. <BR> Youre a long way from home...
7982,Take it easy you'll live longer. <BR> Did you see him? <BR> Who? <BR> The guy. He just came this way. <BR> What guy? <BR> There's somebody else on this boat. <BR> What? What the hell're you talking about. <BR> I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy. <BR> Are you sure? <BR> Of course I'm sure. I saw him. <BR> You sure it wasn't me? <BR> It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
7983,Is there something else that's bothering you Mr. President? <BR> Yes ... It involves some old and forgotten papers.  Things I signed as Vice President.  I want the originals in my office and I don't want copies anywhere else.
7984,If you....if you go back on sedation you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion. <BR> I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  I'll never make it the way I am now.
7985,What? <BR> You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.
7986,My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny. <BR> Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --! <BR> Don't say that! <BR> Well what am I supposed to think? <BR> I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that? <BR> How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope? <BR> No I don't think so. I --
7987,Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story - <BR> Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!
7988,Go on Jill. Some of those kids you still know. <BR> I don't want to. <BR> Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long. <BR> It's not that. <BR> What then? <BR> It's stupid. <BR> It's fun. <BR> I want to go home.  I don't like it here. <BR> Oh Jesus come on will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam.
7989,Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma. <BR> You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you you come out of nowhere and upset things scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit. <BR> What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous Buzz? <BR> You shouldn't listen to her she's a nervous old Nellie. <BR> She thinks someone's trying to kill you. <BR> I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
7990,She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf-- but she'll ride! <BR> Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it John? How you boys comin'? 
7991,Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag. <BR> Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's! <BR> Good I'll be sure to do that Amanda. I'll make a note of it.
7992,How? <BR> Well... for a start... er... there's no killing... <BR> Well OBVIOUSLY there's no killing. <BR> Well... isn't it great?
7993,Okay ... Flynn I'm gonna put you at my terminal down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office. <BR> Swell...I'll log us both on and you can get your Tron thing running... <BR> As long as we stay off the top floor Dillinger'll never know we've been in here...
7994,"If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded. <BR> How far's the river from here, Mose?"
7995,If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon Mr. Cross. <BR> Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down. <BR> What for? <BR> You may think you know what you're dealing with but believe me you don't.
7996,When the stiff's an Irish the cops take it kinda personal. <BR> Can't we get a couple whores over?
7997,The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed? <BR> The inheritance. <BR> Not power.  Not control.
7998,Relax you need to chill the fuck out. <BR> Highway to Hell Highway to Hell. <BR> For Christ sakes girl take a breath.
7999,But can't you see... I love you Antoine. <BR> Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally. <BR> Yes but I can't love a man named Wally.
8000,Hi Buddy.  What are you doing in here? <BR> I've missed you. <BR> Are you okay? <BR> Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us. <BR> Because ... I have to relax. <BR> I was thinking tonight -- do you remember Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight. <BR> Yeah sure a long time ago. <BR> Yes it's been a long time ...
8001,This is -- <BR> This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
8002,What's wrong with you!?! <BR> My arm!  He took my fucking arm! <BR> Shut up!  You let him have it!
8003,Very good busyboy. <BR> Dwarf bowling's illegal. <BR> What are you gonna do call the bowling police?
8004,Is that him? <BR> Yessir. <BR> Give me that.  Now listen to me mister I don't know what you think you're doing but demolishing a building doesn't fall under the definition of 'help'! There's hundreds of people out here and you covered half of them in pieces of glass --
8005,Do you know what time it is? <BR> Uum... around ten?
8006,Madam it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs. <BR> Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov? 
8007,Jury duty?  That's randomly selected by social security numbers. <BR> Random sure. <BR> What you think Death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago?  You're nuts.
8008,"Mr. Nixon, it is possible for even a president to go too far. <BR> Yeah ..."
8009,You... <BR> Moreover... <BR> What? <BR> Only in mutual advantages -- moreover. <BR> What brown hands you have. <BR> That's from skiing. <BR> Skiing?  <BR> Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
8010,This isn't fair you know. Do you always get what you want? <BR> No almost never. <BR> But you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here you meet this guy who should laugh in your face and instead you leave with him!  Betty you are one-of-a-kind...
8011,Why? <BR> Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us. <BR> What happens then?
8012,Ronnie says we don't need'em for another four days.  ...s'there a problem? <BR>  <BR> How's your wife? <BR> Fine. 
8013,What is this place? <BR> Some kind of archive -- <BR> Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins. <BR> You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance real estate politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
8014,Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her. <BR> She pay you much?
8015,So what made you change your mind about Sidney? <BR> Mood swing. I'm manic depressive. <BR> You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate. <BR> I think you're all an act. <BR> And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake Dewey I'm a shit. <BR> I know that. <BR> Yeah? <BR> I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who despite huge tabloid success has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes late at night when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
8016,I wish you didn't have to go so early. <BR> Yeah well Larry and his friends are hungry.  And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
8017,Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy? <BR> So we kill him? <BR> I'm saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do to preserve our interest.
8018,We have to send someone to look for him! <BR> You go if you like but we're not waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!
8019,Where to? <BR> No place special.  Just hanging out. <BR> Sailing?
8020,You call your son Little Chief? <BR> Uh huh... <BR> What'd you say your name was? <BR> Frank...Frank Sullivan. <BR> Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me? <BR> Look pal I'm just askin' how you... <BR> You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live? <BR> Right...and I'm asking how you called the game. <BR> Gordo if this is you so help me... <BR> What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
8021,Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone. the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now. <BR> No Jeffrey!! <BR> Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will believe me.
8022,I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now aren't you? <BR> How...how do you know? <BR> You told me this was how it happened. <BR> I did? <BR> Yeah.
8023,Woah woah woah what the hell what the hell? <BR> What now? <BR> Fences are failing all over the park!  A few minor systems he said! <BR> Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines! <BR> The monitors are failing.
8024,Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69 they traded six hours a day now the clock don't stop London's deregulated the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world sport buying and selling and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it. You done good but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works now school's out. <BR> Mr. Gekko I'm there for you 110%. <BR>  <BR> ...Gordon. <BR> Yeah I'm gonna make you rich Bud Fox. I'm gonna make you rich enough you can afford a girl like Darien. Remember power is the best aphrodisiac. This is your wake-up call. Go to work.
8025,"Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes? <BR> Only the best for my mother. <BR> You promise you'll finish school? <BR> I'll make you very proud."
8026,I missed you Lieutenant. <BR> Sorry.  We had another bat sighting. <BR> Don't let your job interfere with your business.  -- Someone's been talking to Harvey Dent.
8027,Do not tell a lie Richard ... The cornsilk cigarette Harold gave thee behind the store this morning. <BR> I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I swear I ... didn't smoke. <BR> I see ... Well then Richard we have nothing more to talk about do we? <BR> Please Mother it ... it was just one time Mother I'm ... I'm sorry. <BR> So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying. <BR> No no!  Please don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please mama ... <BR> I expect more from thee Richard.
8028,Okay lemme walk you through it. <BR> Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.
8029,Headshots.  Girls to play the girl in our footage.  I like the sorrowful one.  Anybody Else....?  <BR> ...what is this?
8030,Yeah. I'm registered for this class. <BR> What class? <BR> This is U.S. History right? I saw the globe in the window. <BR> Really?
8031,What about him? <BR> Well he doesn't have his Green Card.  He Doesn't have his Greencard.
8032,Uh... excuse me but don't you need a warrant or something? <BR> Not today.   Where are your friends? <BR> They left about a half hour ago. <BR> Where did they go? <BR> I dunno.
8033,If you don't mind me asking... Who are you? <BR> Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So...
8034,Ellie <BR> Oh hello Dad. <BR> I knocked several times. <BR> Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming.  <BR> Well everything's set. Creating quite a furor too. Great stunt King's going to pull. <BR> Stunt? <BR> Landing on the lawn in an autogyro. <BR> Oh yes. I heard. <BR> Yes. Personally I think it's silly too.
8035,I hear things in this house <BR> All new houses have noises. <BR> How long does it have to be a new house? <BR> One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it. <BR> Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time. <BR> He's made some friends hasn't he?
8036,I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something. <BR> You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ... <BR> You're a liar Pancho. A no-good dirty ...
8037,It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough. <BR> You're a liar. <BR> You know I'm not. <BR> YOU'RE A LIAR! <BR> Look at me.
8038,Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay? <BR> Most of the time he is James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
8039,What the fuck... ?! <BR> Why are you following me? <BR> I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm just driving...
8040,I don't know. <BR> Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
8041,Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names?  I'm glad you hit that reporter Stewart. He deserved it. <BR> All right all right! It's your funeral Anne Schuyler!
8042,You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe. <BR> That's what we're here for. Come on Frank. <BR> Don't push it Larry. <BR> You're burned out.
8043,And uh I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee. <BR> How much? <BR> A thousand dollars? <BR> Fine.
8044,You look good. <BR> So do you.  And to think I was worried... <BR> About me? <BR> How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you? <BR> Never better. <BR> Elizabeth? <BR> Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist or pediatric gynaecologist in Sausalito. <BR> Too bad I liked her.  So you're all alone in the House of Pain? <BR> I redecorated.  What about you? <BR> Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore? <BR> Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright? <BR> Yeah. <BR> You need anything? <BR> No. <BR> Really? <BR> I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain naked and it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So here I am four layovers twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
8045,I'll take you to... <BR> Better sign in first hasn't we?
8046,"I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously. <BR> God, Spermy. Must you always feed?"
8047,This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract. <BR> 20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime. <BR> And no questions asked. <BR> Who asked any? <BR> He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract. <BR> I know it...but you want to get where you want to get and back? I need a chief engineer and unless you got a replacement I'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion.
8048,This isn't human blood. <BR> Then what is it? <BR> I don't know --  Look at this blood smear --
8049,I'd have liked to have said goodbye. <BR> He knows. <BR> You sound so sure. <BR> I am about this.
8050,I go with you -- <BR> That what you want? <BR> That's what I want ... <BR> Okay.
8051,...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera. <BR> We split that.
8052,Listen Antonia -- <BR> Tony. Now that I'm home. <BR> Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry. <BR> Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just I don't know into collecting weird tricks. Mind?
8053,Hey you ivy league shit. COME HERE! <BR> Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here in case you haven't noticed.
8054,What's the story? <BR> It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved criminals from all over the world experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
8055,You will?? <BR> For the sake of France Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.
8056,No disrespect Tommy but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us? <BR> Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
8057,Man we fucked him up. <BR> Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.
8058,Where's Junior? <BR> He killed your stoolie embezzler father and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
8059,"Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there? <BR> ...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do."
8060,Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off you see more money we can raise. <BR> I see. <BR> I know that you are an artist and I am sure you are very religious.
8061,Kimberly Burroughs eh?  What do you want? <BR> I thought...I thought you might be able to help me. <BR> Yeah how? <BR> I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me. <BR> Nice work.  Maybe if you're real lucky you'll wind up in here with me.  But I doubt you'll survive that long.
8062,Where you think you're going? <BR> Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it? <BR> Well you just turn around and walk the other way. <BR> You mean I can't even get outa here? <BR> Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back? <BR> I'll walk back.
8063,I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him you'll regret it. <BR> No. <BR> Maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but soon and for the rest of your life. <BR> But what about us? <BR> We'll always have Paris. We didn't have we'd lost it until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night. <BR> And I said I would never leave you. <BR> And you never will. But I've got a job to do too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa I'm no good at being noble but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now now...
8064,What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her? <BR> People done it. If they could we could. <BR> Lots must a died too. <BR> Well we ain't out a it yet.
8065,It won't work on you. <BR> What are you talking about?
8066,You really think I'm stupid don't you Gittes? <BR> I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want give me a day or two and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home. <BR> I want the rest of the pictures. <BR> What pictures? <BR> This broad hired you Gittes not Evelyn Mulwray. <BR> Yeah? <BR> Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray she hired you and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered. <BR> I heard it was an accident. <BR> C'mon you think you're dealing with a bunch of assholes? Mulwray had salt water in his goddam lungs! Now how did he get that... in a fresh water reservoir?
8067,"How long have I been here? <BR> Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel? <BR> I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip. <BR> There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room. <BR> What do you mean? <BR> What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck! <BR> Sera... <BR> Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life. <BR> Me neither. <BR> So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now! <BR> Sera you are crazy. <BR> So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans. <BR> Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk? <BR> That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff? <BR> You haven't seen the worst of it. These last few days I've been very controlled. I knock things over... I throw up all the time.  Now I feel really good... You're like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance, but that won't last forever. You'll get tired of it really quickly. Believe me."
8068,You and your husband never discussed her? <BR> He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me. <BR> A complete surprise? <BR> Yes. <BR> But I thought you'd hired a private investigator. <BR> A private investigator? <BR> Mr. Gittes. <BR> Well yes.
8069,Julian Cross worked for the water department? <BR> Yes. No. <BR> He did or he didn't? <BR> He owned it.
8070,Ever seen him before? <BR> No... No...  I swear... <BR> Whats this place? A hotel of some kind? <BR> Yeah... The Diplomat. <BR> Where? <BR> What? <BR> Where are we? <BR> Finsbury Park. Were in Finsbury Park. <BR> Where are the kids? <BR> What kids? <BR> There were six on offer you scumbag. Where are the other five? <BR> I dont know...  This is just a delivery place man! I swear I dont know where the kids are... I work for Martin thats all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows... <BR> And who does Friedman work for? <BR> The company. We all work for the company. <BR> What company? <BR> I dont know. I dont know man. I dont even know Friedman that well... I...  Man youve got to get me out of here... <BR> How many of you scumbags are here? <BR> Just me...  Martins gone back to the Ambassador. Look... <BR> Whats the Ambassador? <BR> Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. Hes got a safe...  I need a doctor... <BR> What about the staff?  Theyre in on whats going on arent they?  How many of them? <BR> F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look man Ive got to get to...
8071,You know even if we do get those tapes back people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy. <BR> Maybe.  Maybe not. <BR> Ian they will misplace our evidence shoot holes in our testimony and say some special effects genius created the animals.  The only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a T-rex in the middle of times Square.
8072, <BR> And this happened before you and I hooked up? <BR> It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me. <BR> Racist piece of shit. <BR> I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to. <BR> He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in. <BR> Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and -- <BR> Don't worry about it. I'll stay.
8073,When you get up in the morning how do you decide what shade of black to wear? <BR> Now let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having is it not with a man or not with a woman?
8074,She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor which is just one of her many genetic gifts. <BR> I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
8075,Who are you? <BR> Who me?  Why I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face. <BR> You've got a name haven't you? <BR> Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne. <BR> Peter Warne? I don't like it. <BR> Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning. <BR> Pleased to meet you Mr. Warne ... <BR> The pleasure is all mine.
8076,He's still here. <BR> He couldn't get his car started. <BR> When are you going to let the police know? <BR> You call them if you want. <BR> And what about you?
8077,Don't touch me! <BR> I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia. <BR> I'm not laughing Steven. <BR> You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here let the games begin! <BR> Haven't they already?
8078,What you're doing Miss Starling is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview and refusing to share information with me. For the third time! <BR> Dr. Chilton I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case. <BR> He's my patient! I have rights!  I'm not just some turnkey Miss Starling. I shouldn't even be here this afternoon. I had a ticket to Holiday on Ice.
8079,I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once right? <BR> If you're lucky.  Then again it depends on what you call living.  <BR> I don't mean to pry but I see a kid walking around with a big knapsack on his back and I begin to wonder if all his worldly possessions aren't stowed in there. Are you in some kind of trouble or what?
8080,This can't be happening.  My career's at a peak I finally met a cute guy I just bought a new house... <BR> Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.
8081,Sorry. You've lost me... <BR> I'm asking what you're here for. <BR> What?
8082,"Colonel Greenhill's compliments, sir. The Colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of Rangers in the field, fully armed and... <BR> Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about? <BR> Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir. <BR> Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know? <BR> My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches. <BR> JOINT action? <BR> Yes sir...We've received information about a band of Comanches under a chief named Scar..."
8083,No no thanks. Hey don't- <BR> Well where is it? I- <BR> No no no no you just... just watch the road. I'll get it- <BR> Okay.
8084,If that's what you call it. <BR> Cecile I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did. <BR> What do I do then? <BR> Well did you like it? <BR> Well... I don't know - it was weird. At first it felt icky then it felt kind of okay. Then I started getting really hot and then I started shaking and then like I don't t know... it felt like an explosion but a good one.
8085,I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then. <BR> His body was found on January 1 1993 but do you know if that was long after he had died? <BR> No I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more. <BR> What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries I think. <BR> Well Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you. <BR> What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries? <BR> Unfortunately I'm not familiar with Dr. Becker and Dr. Gries passed away three four years ago.
8086,Lucas and his Romper Room stage. <BR> I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 20.
8087,Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for... <BR> About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
8088,Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it? <BR> It's Sunday.
8089,Do you think wed let him get away with the murder of my brother? <BR> We? You and your parents killed your husband? <BR> No. Not us...
8090,Did Max mention anything about any jobs? <BR> What about boxing? <BR> What about it? <BR> What are you saying? <BR> You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights you'd talk to Max. <BR> So? <BR> So it was a draw. <BR> Yeah I'm 5-5 and 1. <BR> So it's not a winning record. <BR> It's not losing record. <BR> That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record -- <BR> Don't be shitty. <BR> How am I being shitty? <BR> Don't be shitty. <BR> I wouldn't keep bugging you but you said he said he would have a job for us. <BR> I'm not gonna bring it up to him. <BR> Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up... <BR> I'll page you. <BR> Yeah. Page me. You know the number? <BR> Yeah. I know the number. <BR> Cause if you don't know the number I can page you with the number so you'll have the number. <BR> I know the number. <BR> I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done? <BR> I got no idea. <BR> Ask if he said anything to her. <BR> I will. <BR> I'll page you with the number. <BR> Bye.
8091,You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found. <BR> Show you right on a map.
8092,... If it happens it happens. If it doesn't it doesn't. Do you understand what I'm saying? You never know what's going to happen next and the moment you think you know that's the moment you don't know a goddamn thing. That's what we call a paradox. Are you following me? <BR> Sure Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels. <BR> Jesus man you're one fucking mess.
8093,What do you know about my father? <BR> He's a rapist. Like mine.
8094,Someone's bringing in a kitten...? <BR> No no no.... we'll punch <u>in</u> a kitten.  Um... <u>Later</u>. <BR> ...you're gonna Punch in a Kitten Later. <BR> Yes.  <BR> Why...?
8095,Ian you're not insane!  I'm so glad! <BR> Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
8096,I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and -- <BR> Sounds good. But right now I should go. <BR> You should stay. <BR> I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow so... <BR> Okay.
8097,I don't know. <BR> You don't remember anything else? <BR> No  There is something...something there I can't tell... I can't describe it.  There are things there.... but I'm... here.
8098,Probably on their first date right? <BR> It's a narrow view. <BR> 
8099,Oh that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt Annie. He was in the choir with you. <BR> Oh yes yes.
8100,Why is she trying to kill me? <BR> They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is but they know!
8101,How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with? <BR> How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
8102,Listen James about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control. <BR> They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones. <BR> Well... <BR> It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write. <BR> Really? That's remarkable. <BR> I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in bed I figure them out. The stories.
8103,This is wonderfully accommodating of you all.  Now I won't have to come looking for you. <BR> You were looking for us? <BR> Yeah I have something I've been meaning to give you. <BR> Yeah and what might that be? <BR> An ass-beating.  Would you like yours first Mr. Sim?
8104,And more importantly -- <BR> I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
8105,Twins Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities? <BR> You're an actor Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park. <BR> Oh I did Shakespeare in the Park Max. I got mugged. I was playing Richard the Second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard.
8106,Yeah? <BR> Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread ma'am. <BR> This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with. <BR> I know ma'am... on'y it's for a ole lady no teeth gotta sof'n it with water so she can chew it an' she's hongry. <BR> Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges. <BR> I shore would like to do that ma'am but the fack is we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out I mean--for the trip. <BR> You can't get no loaf a bread for a dime. We only got fifteen-cent loafs.
8107,Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis? <BR> You guys are so sweet!
8108,This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop? <BR> Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ... <BR> Look at this. A multi-generational gathering of scumbags ...
8109,Well that ought to be about the end of that. <BR> Yup.
8110,Get us out of here... <BR> Nicholas... <BR> Get us out!
8111,You think it can be done? <BR> Are you considering a comeback tour? <BR> Tell me... <BR> It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew... <BR> The hard part ... <BR>  <BR> Is he still working here ? <BR> The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular - <BR> I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me
8112,Ace don't... listen don't... don't make a scene all right? <BR> I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch. <BR> She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage. <BR> Yeah? Nicky I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch. <BR> Hey be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. Don't fuck up in here.
8113,Do you realize how immoral this all is? <BR> Max I've got a hit series. <BR> Yeah I know; but you're adding fake laughs.
8114,"Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now. <BR> I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came. <BR> Who? <BR> The Cenobites."
8115,Tom are you okay? <BR> You try. You try talking to her. <BR> Tom. Tom! Tell me what's going on? <BR> I give up.
8116,Can I give you a kiss good night? <BR> You better not Jeffrey. <BR> Okay. okay. <BR> Goodnight. <BR> See ya tomorrow.
8117,No... <BR> Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie cause the man has acute angina and I don't want to get him all worked up. <BR> He has a cute what...?
8118,Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly? <BR> You are to be killed exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions you know?  If you survive though you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight. <BR> Death is a very light thing for you. <BR> Death is... everything for me.  Now you have to go to your cell and I to dicker with Jerses... you'll be fed well.  I want you to be fit as you can be; I want you to win for me tomorrow!  I want all my gladiators to win and be happy!  Besides I've never owned a Roman general before.
8119,Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You were jealous you fought he fell hit his head. It was an accident but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no? <BR> ...no... <BR> Who is she? And don't give me that crap about it being your sister. You don't have a sister.
8120,No. <BR> Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number? <BR> Ha un numero di telefono?
8121,The kids? Why are they... <BR> Little fuckers are thieves rapists pickpockets murderers you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em...
8122,I need to get this letter to someone. <BR> I can't take you out of here in your condition... <BR> And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided. <BR> No it hasn't. <BR> Yes. [Beat] It has. Everything up 'till today is done. Everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs.
8123,Why can't it be a ribbon? <BR> It can't be a ribbon cause AIDS had a ribbon cause the Yellow Ribbon thing had a ribbon cause...
8124,Hey Buffers.  You look thrashed. <BR> Thanks. <BR> You and Cassandra get anything done last night?
8125,You want to come splash around. <BR> I'm just warning you I can't swim.
8126,I thought I told you to move that truck! <BR> Relax Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke? <BR> You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job. <BR> Some job. Here have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems but everybody's got problems.  <BR> Not here.
8127,Wait. <BR> What? <BR> I'm not leaving. I want to know why you and dad are so freaked out. Three of my classmates are dead.
8128,Will these boards hold? <BR> The boards are solid oak planks and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this least nothing the size of the beasts. <BR> Good.
8129,It was our dream too Buddy together ... always. <BR> Do you really want this Dick? <BR> This.  Above all. <BR> And then you'll be happy?
8130,He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor no one would die this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red. <BR> He's flowing Gordo. Piece of cake.
8131,You know what I want to do? <BR> Yeah. <BR> What do I want to do? <BR> You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me. <BR> Why? <BR> Because you know why. You know. <BR> Because your a virgin? <BR> Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby. <BR> You think I want a baby? When you're with me you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff. <BR> Why is that? <BR> Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it. <BR> I wouldn't believe it? <BR> I don't know. I just think that you would love it. <BR> But I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us. <BR> What things? I'm telling you nothing's going to change.  I want to make you happy. That's all.
8132,Some party huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day. <BR> No. <BR> No what? <BR> No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home. <BR> You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here. <BR> I don't want to be here. Don't worry I love you Daddy I do. But I want to go home. <BR> Jesus. Listen Jill tell you what. Tomorrow morning you still want to go home I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something. <BR> I called Mommy. <BR> What? You called Mommy? Just now? <BR> Yes. <BR> Jesus why? <BR> I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me. <BR> Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first? <BR> See I knew you'd be mad. <BR> Yeah. Yeah right I'm mad. What'd you tell her for Christ sake? <BR> I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy don't be mad at me. <BR> Well I guess I am. I planned this I planned all this you know. I mean it's sort of pathetic but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother.  C'mon we're gonna call her before she leaves.
8133,Yeah. <BR> Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie's guineas at LUNA and bring them to Spa.  Jimmy's bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode sleds. We'll meet you at Spa in the VIP room.
8134,Goodbye Preysing I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've... <BR> Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day but Manchester -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester.  <BR> What? <BR> Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go it's off. Thank you gentlemen.  <BR> If you actually have news from Manchester then... <BR> Gentlemen I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated. <BR> Preysing you're joking with us.
8135,And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going men? <BR> So you must be the Red Dragon.
8136,Ace. <BR> Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
8137,"What's that? <BR> Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha! <BR> What? What?! <BR> Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters. <BR> How can you tell? <BR> Florida license plate. <BR> He ate a car? <BR> No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here..."
8138,What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight? <BR> Astronomical.
8139,Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy? <BR> Oh yeah... Man I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
8140,"Bernstein. <BR> Who the fuck are they?  Bob, are you working on revoking the Posts's television license?  Good."
8141,Where have you been? <BR> In the village.  Look what I found.
8142,"Shut up, Merle... Williams. <BR> Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess."
8143,Do you have any brothers? <BR> No no brothers no sisters. <BR> Me neither. Nor does Marge. All only children -- what does that mean?
8144,Yes ... ? <BR> ... when I don't. It comes down to one thing Mrs. Peel. Trust.
8145,Yeah? <BR> It's me. <BR> Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and-- <BR> -- Did you set it up? <BR> Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred. <BR> We had a deal. <BR> We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime. <BR> Fine.     Ten o'clock.
8146,What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line right? <BR> No no.  See all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa-- <BR> This gonna take long? <BR> Wait so I'm a big hero to my folks right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
8147,But they know. <BR> They can know all they like it won't do them the slightest bit of good -- <BR> They know. <BR> They know? So what? They have nothing there is nothing to connect us to that bodies stuff. <BR> Except the money.
8148,Well? Why aren't you there right now? <BR> Sir that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on - <BR> Do you recall my instructions to you Starling? What were they? <BR> To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir - <BR> Then do that Starling. Do just exactly that. <BR> Sir what is it? There's something you're not telling me. <BR> Miggs has been murdered. <BR> Murdered...? How? <BR> The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him all afternoon and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...? <BR> I'm here sir I just - I don't know how to feel about it. <BR> You don't have to feel any way about it. Lecter did it to amuse himself. Why not what can they do? Take away his books for awhile and no jello...  I know it got ugly today. But this is your report Starling - take it as far as you can. On your own time outside of class. Now carry on.
8149,Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster and he didn't give a damn who knew it. <BR> Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.
8150,Ha ha.  That's very funny Buzz.  This is serious!! <BR> Hey Woody!?  Where'd ya go?
8151,Yeah. <BR> There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
8152,What's she doing? <BR> Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while you know.
8153,Why does God let there be bad things? <BR> I honestly don't know. Try to sleep baby. <BR> Can you come with me in my dreams?
8154,InGen is a genetics corporation isn't it? <BR> Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
8155,I haven't changed my mind Westley I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have!  I never will! That's clear enough isn't it? <BR> You've made that quite evidentwith all your threats of annulment.  Well it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment. <BR> You've got a good thing and you're hanging on to it huh?  All right You win. I'll just have to get used to you. I admit I'm licked. But only because I'm worried. I've had detectives all over the country searching for her. I've seen thousands of photographs. Fortune tellers nuts every crank in the country has written me.  Haven't slept one night this week. If I don't find her I'll go crazy.
8156,I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate. <BR> And you can't concentrate with me around?. <BR> It's difficult.
8157,... so I started tailing him. <BR> This Zen master surfer. <BR> Bodhi yeah.  I'm on him all day right.  He goes here he goes there he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan. <BR> Did he rob it? <BR> Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy Roach waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out right?! <BR> Yeah or cashing a check. <BR> Wait wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling. <BR> Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man which I always hate because it looks bad on the report. <BR> Angelo... I'm right this time.  We can still win this one.
8158,Mrs. Richards. <BR> Karen. <BR> Karen...  ... isn't it awful I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done. <BR> Nobody's done so much Eve you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it? <BR> Well... Miss Channing's affairs are in such good shape... there isn't enough to keep me as busy as I should be really - not that I've ever considered anything that would take me away from her... but the other day - when I heard Mr. Fabian tell Miss Channing that her understudy was going to have a baby and they'd have to replace her...
8159,What do you mean? <BR> To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up padding. <BR> Why? <BR> Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
8160,That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island! <BR> I know that. <BR> AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF!
8161,This is the last time I come to this place. <BR> Excuse me? <BR> Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired. <BR> We're sorry ma'am. We got a little carried away. <BR> Well I don't know if sorry can make up for it. I found your remarks highly offensive.
8162,This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours? <BR> I guess so.
8163,dollars in c-notes a numeric pager a double-A battery and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK. <BR> We're going to New York? <BR> Yes. You're going to New York. <BR> And the money. Where do we bring the money? <BR> That money is your per diem. <BR> And where do we bring it?
8164,Shh. I'll tell you. <BR> They hurt his head. <BR> Who Dorothy? <BR> Don. help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
8165,Alright I admit it you had me there. You're better than most of them anyway... do you have a headshot? <BR> No wait... what happened next Betty? <BR> 
8166,Hi. I'm here for the big show? <BR> Your name please? <BR> Juno MacGuff.
8167,I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to reach for one of the books up there ...  And then I don't know the sky fell on top of me. <BR> It just won't do will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word and then when I finally get started on something when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do will it? <BR> I didn't ask to come here. You invited me remember?  If you want me to leave all you have to do is say so. <BR> How long have you been here? <BR> Three nights. <BR> And how long did I tell you you could stay? <BR> Two or three nights. <BR> It sounds like our time is up doesn't it? <BR> I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end right? <BR> No hard feelings okay? It's a small place and I can't get my work done with you around. <BR> You don't have to apologize.  The coast is probably clear now anyway. <BR> Are you going to be all right? <BR> Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means.  <BR> Do you need some money? Some extra clothes? <BR> Not a penny not a stitch. I'm cool man.  <BR> Take good care of yourself okay? <BR> You too. And make sure the light is green before you cross the street.  Oh by the way I liked your book. I think you're a hell of a good writer. 
8168,Yeah. <BR> I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater. <BR> Is there something wrong with the phone? <BR> In the living room. <BR> Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed? <BR> Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
8169,It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut. <BR> You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job? <BR> Just be careful okay? <BR> I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial don't you think? <BR> Guess so. <BR> 48 hours.  Back before you know it.
8170,Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out. <BR> How's Granma since we got her in the tent?
8171,Yeah? <BR> Just wanted to let you know. <BR> I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me. <BR> She likes you okay. <BR> I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over too. I have a girlfriend now. <BR> You can if you want. <BR> Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend? <BR> This one's history. Moving on... <BR> The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation. <BR> Patrick we need to focus.
8172,Don't mind if I do. <BR> LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies. <BR> Where's that gun you were bragging on today?
8173,Hey! Where are you going?! <BR> Hey listen jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well I never had sex with twelve different guys! <BR> No but you sucked enough dick! <BR> Yeah I went down on a few guys... <BR> A few? <BR> ...And one of those guys was you! The last one I might add which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you so if you want to have a complex about it go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore because you were plenty busy yourself before you met me! <BR> Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them like any decent person?! <BR> Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy we'd make out and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved. <BR> I feel sick. <BR> I love you. Don't feel sick. <BR> Every time I kiss you now I'm going to taste thirty-six other guys.
8174,But it was all we had. <BR> ... but it was all we had.
8175,Hey Sheriff. How's everything? <BR> Oh you know the usual... keeping the world safe. <BR> ...I meant your food. <BR> Oh right... 's fine. Thanks.
8176,Did... did you really come here because you love this guy? <BR> Yes... Not the actor though the doctor. I think.
8177,I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again? <BR> Dr. Homer Wells. <BR> I just hope he won't expect us to say *Grace* all the time.
8178,May I say something Mr. President? <BR> There's no secrets here Al. <BR> You've never been a greater example to the country than you are now sir but ... but you need to get out more sir and talk to the people.  No one I know feels ... close to you.
8179,What? <BR> Cut his fucking throat. <BR> Whose? <BR> ZIAT... What do I got to lose huh! What do I got to lose. And I'd really enjoy it.
8180,SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION <BR> SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION <BR> SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY <BR> SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
8181,Yes. You'll have a great story won't you? <BR> Yeah swell.
8182,He has a six months lease and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself and none of the neighbors got close to him or his wife. <BR> I think they missed their chance with her. <BR> She never left the apartment -- <BR> Then where is she -- in the ice box? <BR> -- until yesterday morning. <BR> What time? <BR> Six ayem.

He kills a play every time he farts. <BR> Postpone. We have every right. <BR> Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater. <BR> I've had three straight washouts Sidney. <BR> You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
8185,A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily. <BR> Don't get sore Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollarsand I need it quick. I'm in a jam. <BR> What's the thousand bucks for? <BR> To tear down the Walls of Jericho. <BR> What! <BR> Never mind . . . Listensuppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled. <BR> Huh? <BR> That she's going to marry somebody else. <BR> You're drunk. <BR> Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you? <BR> If it's on the level. <BR> Well I got it Joe. <BR> Who's she gonna marry? <BR> It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours. <BR> I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk. <BR> Wait a minute Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail! <BR> I'd put you there myself. <BR> Sure. I wouldn't blame you either. <BR> Who's the guy she's gonna marry? <BR> I am Joe. <BR> You! <BR> Yeah. <BR> Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more. <BR> For heaven's sake Joestop being an editor for just a minute.  We've been friends for a long time haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level.
8186,What are you thinking about? <BR> By a strange coincidence I was thinking of you. <BR> Really? <BR> Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy. <BR> What'd you say we're supposed to be doing? <BR> Hitch-hiking. <BR> Well you've given me a very good example of the hiking
8187,Look Sam don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again. <BR> You don't have to explain yourself to me Deirdre. <BR>  <BR> You're a hired gun Deirdre -- just like me. <BR> Exactly.  And last night I wanted to be with someone who was just like me.
8188,Your lady friend did. <BR> The ladys not a friend. Shes a whore.  Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an Austrian here in London. And not just movies.
8189,Same shit. <BR> I can hear it now it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'. <BR> I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going? <BR> To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name.  Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.

8192,Perhaps you could present me now Mr. Pimenov. <BR> Please Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
8193,What do you think of him? <BR> Hal? Well Hal and I have been friends for a long time. <BR> You go to school together? <BR> No we never did that <BR> Oh -- <BR> We're connected by a relative. One time one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago though. How'd you come to work for him? <BR> Well I really think he's got a chance. <BR> You do? <BR> Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new. <BR> He ain't really new. <BR> He is to a lot of people. <BR> He was a good Judge but that was a long time ago. <BR> You know I'll bet you he makes it with a majority. <BR> Where are you from? <BR> Southern California. <BR> You always live there? <BR> Spent time in Arizona. Why? <BR> Well I admire your optimism and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars? <BR> I know a couple. <BR> No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who? <BR> Ah... Peter Finch. <BR> Who? <BR> Peter Finch -- he's English. <BR> I never heard of him. Name somebody else. <BR> Ryan O'Neal. <BR> You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them? <BR> Oh you meet them at parties and stuff. <BR> I'll be damned. Boy if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker wouldn't that be something? <BR> Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here. <BR> I'll be dammed.
8194,That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes. <BR> EMPTYLINE

We wouldn't have him <u>say</u> the flippin' thing it wasn't corny.  Put... listen it's not a question we're locked <u>in</u> to this speech.  NO We're Are You Listening?  LOCKED IN.  We're we're playing way <u>past</u> it we're <u>past</u> it -- it's the set-up for...he has <u>got</u> to say the speech.  Tell Ames to meet me at the West Gate in... 
8196,Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor? <BR> You know you can. <BR> Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services. <BR> Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know? <BR> Just what I told you. <BR> Nothing else?
8197,Yeah two more chairs and they got a dining-room set. <BR> Why are you so hostile? <BR> 'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television. <BR> 
8198,"Say it. We're beat! <BR> No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to..."
8199,I seem to be out of gas. <BR> It's sort of funny - you being out of gas - I mean Shell Oil and everything -
8200,Tony. <BR> Hey. <BR> How you doin'? <BR> How you doin'? <BR> All right yeah. You got that thing for me? <BR> What thing? Oh Nicky... I thought you was layin'. <BR> I was layin'? No no I'm taking it. I was takin' it. <BR> You sure? <BR> I'm positive. <BR> Well I'm a little confused here. <BR> You're a little confused? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Maybe if I stick your fuckin' face through this window over here like you know you'll - you'll get unconfused. Give me the fuckin' money!
8201,This is <u>nothing</u>  Wait'll you've worked with a movie star one time this is nothing we keep him shot-up and happy -- the Old Days I used to think I was a <u>pharmacist</u> the kind of stuff I had to do.  One time... <BR> Cause the beans y'know y'can tell if they're <u>puttin</u> stuff in it.
8202,You told me Bourne was dead. <BR> There was a mistake. <BR> I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak. <BR> Will it track back to us? <BR> No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find it's just going to make Conklin look worse. <BR> And the Landy woman? <BR> She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account... <BR> Anything else?
8203,You want to come in get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home or you could crash in the guest room. <BR> Sure. Maybe coffee. <BR> Phone's out. I hope the pipe's --
8204,"Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas? <BR> I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something? <BR> Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place. <BR> Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack. <BR> It's not about sex, Ben. I'll make you up a bed on the sofa. Do it for me. We can talk till late and then sleep till late. As you know, I am my own boss."
8205,But you're going skiing with us Yankees aren't you? <BR> What? <BR> At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and -- <BR> How did you know that? <BR> Everybody knows Freddie Miles. <BR> Is Freddie in Rome? <BR> Now? I don't think so. But I've met him of course and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R. <BR> I've left Marge Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now in Rome. <BR> Sorry I wouldn't have made a joke if -- <BR> Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life.
8206,He's got those love handles. <BR> I don't have love handles.
8207,You ass. <BR> I'm sorry I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy. <BR> You are so not funny.
8208,What are you talking about? <BR> C'mon I'll show you.
8209,Who's there! <BR> Buzz Fazeli. <BR> NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right.  Knock-knock. <BR> Who's there?
8210,London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather you control the world. <BR> After the cold war ...
8211,Well there's always people you don't know at these things but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey. <BR> A jockey? You mean like -- <BR> Horses right. Vernon something...  Hardapple.
8212,"I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel? <BR> We can go to one if you'd prefer. <BR> No, this is fine. I was just wondering."
8213,Listen it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides it only began after we moved! <BR> There is of course another possible explanation which I dearly hope is not the case.
8214,I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill. <BR> Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes -- 
8215,Excuse... excuse me when do I go on? <BR> Who are you? <BR> Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian. <BR> Oh comedian. Yes. Oh uh... you're on next. <BR> What do you mean next? <BR> Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act. <BR> No it can't be because he's a comic. <BR> Yes. <BR> So what are you telling me you're putting on two comics in a row? <BR> Why not? <BR> No I'm sorry I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian. <BR> It's okay. <BR> No because they're-they're laughing so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind I prefer- <BR> Will you relax please? They're gonna love you I know. <BR> I prefer not to because... look they're laughing at him. See so what are yuh telling me-
8216,Oh. That's uh my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff. <BR> Wow you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there Mark. <BR> Shut up.
8217,That was really sweet... <BR> I meant about my idea. <BR> I think it's time we got some professional help. <BR> Like a detective. <BR> No... Like a psychiatrist. <BR> Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
8218,Go ahead and laugh you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line and if you cross it they fuck you up. <BR> I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
8219,She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone. <BR> If this girl Mary Crane were here you'd have no reason to hide her would you? <BR> Of course not. <BR> If she paid you well? <BR> Now look...! <BR> Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you? <BR> I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women! <BR> I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry. <BR> That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother. <BR> Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother? <BR> No. I told you she's confined... <BR> Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss. <BR> Sick old women are sharp. Come on I won't disturb... <BR> No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man believe it or not and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think... <BR> All right!  Might save me a lot of leg-work if I could just talk to your mother.  But I'd need a warrant for that won't I?
8220,"See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank. <BR> No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick! <BR> 'Fraid not, baby. He belongs here. With me. We're the same. Brothers. Equal and opposite. Pure appetite. Pure banality. Too much feeling. None at all."
8221,Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs. <BR> The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen kid.
8222,I'd really like to see you. <BR> Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you. <BR> That's not quite what I had in mind.
8223,Nudie pictures what do you think? <BR> Jesus Christ how can you be so stupid? <BR> I don't know. He was just so charming. All he did was talk about how I had killer legs and how we wanted to photograph them. Things just got out of hand from there.  Mom? Are you there? Mom?  Mother!!!!
8224,You know I don't feel like playin' tennis. <BR> ...as soon as Andy got back home Nicky heard about our talk in the car. <BR> Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera? <BR> Next morning bright and early I get the call.
8225,Stick around. Please. Tell you what - we'll put Stanislavsky on his plane you and I then go somewhere and talk. <BR> Well - if I'm not in the way... <BR> I won't be a minute.
8226,-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance -- <BR> If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already! <BR> I don't want neutral...I want dead --
8227,Control ON. <BR> No evidently you reversed the polarity on his lobal travel. Secure another sinex drop.
8228,Did you tell Walter? <BR> I told Walter. <BR> Does he still love you? <BR> It didn't come up.
8229,What's this? <BR> The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them. <BR> Thorough man.
8230,"...by you? <BR> By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization. <BR> Well, there's a lot to be said for that.  And I'm going to show a clip.  You've seen it before, you've seen it <u>many</u> times...  But I'm going to ask you to look at it once more.  With the election one day off, and the President's standing in the polls..."
8231,Why is that funny? <BR> It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown. <BR> Was he right?
8232,Whoever's behind my husband's death why have they gone to all this trouble? <BR> Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs that I don't know. <BR> I'll pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to Hollis and who is involved.
8233,He... he loved me. <BR> Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
8234,Masseria's scared. He might make our deal. <BR> We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
8235,Everything in order? <BR> All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave. <BR> Monsieur Blaine I don't ask you to explain anything. <BR> I'm going to anyway because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me. <BR> Yes. <BR> But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true Ilsa?
8236,There were complaints by other guests and damage to his room.  We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior. <BR> His behavior... ? <BR> He couldn't or refused to pay.  We extended credit... <BR> Look where is he?! <BR> There was an incident a few days ago... a nervous breakdown they said.  The police took him.  They left this address in case anyone...
8237,Is she...alright? <BR> I thought she was dead. For sure.
8238,On your own time? <BR> Happy to do it. <BR> Then check it out.  I'll be in the office.
8239,It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father.  Or did you think this between us was friendship?  Just because you went fishing with my father I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away? <BR> Now look... <BR>  <BR> There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer. <BR> 
8240,... I don't really know you yet Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red? <BR> Oh I like satin I like pink ... <BR> What kind of uh ... music do you like? <BR> I like jazz ... <BR> Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ... <BR> Elvis I like too. <BR> Oh yeah he's good.
8241,So how long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from? <BR> Oh I'm in her acting class. <BR> Oh - you're an actress. <BR> Well I do commercials sort of...
8242,Donut? <BR> No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing? <BR> I don't but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico. <BR> I knew I could count on you. <BR> I got a lot of free time you know what I mean?
8243,Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole. <BR> Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
8244,Agent Starling! Telephone! <BR> Agent Mapp! Thank you!
8245,Betty I thought this would be the best way. You know throw you into it... <BR> What the hell's going on? <BR> If you need a minute that's okay. But I thought you'd want to --
8246,What is it?  What are you? <BR> There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die all of us I saw it!
8247,I'm going to fill it right now. <BR> Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
8248,But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels invaders plunder our shores... <BR> --And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued? <BR> I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter. <BR> Well then I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters so you can avoid their castles.
8249,Did you /hear/ that Oliver. <BR> Yes Betty.  But the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset.
8250,I'm a little in shock quite frankly... <BR> Now instead of the cops only lookin' at Nicky they started looking at Green too. And he was supposed to be our squeaky...
8251,Yah yah course I remember.  How are ya? What time is it? <BR> Oh geez. It's quarter to eleven.  I hope I dint wake you. <BR> No that's okay. <BR> Yah I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd and I saw you on the news there. <BR> Yah. <BR> I thought geez is that Margie Olmstead?

It's great to hear from ya. <BR> Yah... Yah yah. Geeze Margie!
8252,What happens when the baby comes? <BR> We're moving.  I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife my parents it's been very rough on them.
8253,Wait. Please sit down Mr. Gittes. We're... well we're not anxious for this to get around but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know the farmers there have no legal right to our water and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first naturally.  But well we've been trying to help some of them out keep them from going under. Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff. <BR> Yeah a little runoff. Where are those orchards? <BR> I said the northwest valley. <BR> That's like saying they're in Arizona. <BR> Mr. Gittes my field men are out and I can't give you an exact location...
8254,Where's Sid? <BR> Damned if I know. She ditched me. <BR> You weren't supposed to leave her alone. <BR> I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together.
8255,Jesus Frankie I'm your brother! <BR> That's why we're only breaking one arm.
8256,How are you holding up? <BR> I'm swell. <BR> And all we've got is a witch doctor! <BR> Yeah.
8257,Why can't you be my champion? <BR> If I am your judge I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King I cannot be your husband. <BR> And you cannot love me... <BR> The laws my laws must bind everyone high and low or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come... <BR> And if he cannot be found no other knight will champion me though you beseeched each and every one of them. Why be king if there is no one you can call loyal subject but an eager boy?
8258,I should maybe talk to you. <BR> Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
8259,Everything okay? <BR> Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on? <BR> You didn't tell him about me? <BR> No.
8260,Smythe what do you do with yourself - I mean when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself? <BR> Well sir I putter. <BR> Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself then what? <BR> I just putter. <BR> Hmmm you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter? <BR> Oh no sir. I putter with me hands. <BR> Well isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it? <BR> Well sir I'll show you.
8261,Do you think he can do it? <BR> I don't know. <BR> He's a very sweet man. <BR> Where are you going now? <BR> Home. <BR> Someone waiting for you? <BR> No one's waiting. <BR> There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven? <BR> If I'm sleeping with him and I haven't said I am then so what? <BR> So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm. <BR> But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom? <BR> I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy. <BR> Do you want to talk about doing crazy things. <BR> Yes. <BR> Never mind.
8262,Congratulations Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning. <BR> This isn't a game. <BR> Quite right but we still make the rules. <BR> Rules are made to be broken. <BR> People too. <BR> Then who wins? <BR> You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ...
8263,Are you ready colonel? <BR> Yes ... But let me first see you.
8264,They took him from me. <BR> It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open. <BR> I know! <BR> Don't quit Sarah.  Our son need you. <BR> I know but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission. <BR> Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
8265,Alright honey just calm down take a deep breath and step out of the circle. <BR> Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.
8266,Twenty thousand dollars. <BR> Yeah I'm gonna have to go to L.A.
8267,Does Phil know how you guys feel? <BR> I don't know. <BR> You should tell him.  That's something he can take with him.
8268,What Howard? <BR> We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
8269,...Not far now. <BR> Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
8270,And you got to him before we could. <BR> I killed him??? <BR> You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you! <BR> I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
8271,What's it smell like? <BR> Smell?  Uh something like methylcyanoacrylate. <BR> Like Crazy Glue? <BR> Yes.  That's it.  He's got it.  Oh God he's got it!
8272,"Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say. <BR> All the equipment is brand new. <BR> No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks."
8273,Am I alone in this room? Are you here...  Why are you doing this?! <BR> Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
8274,But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her? <BR> As long as she brings food and supplies she'll be welcome.
8275,It's all right. <BR> You sure? Maybe next week we could... <BR> Uh-huh. No we'll do it later. 'S only a birthday right? I'll have another one next year...
8276,Who's that? <BR> The Devil man. Rene Ricard. Art critic  writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are.. <BR> Who am I? <BR> SAMO. <BR> Oh yeah..
8277,You guys used to work together? <BR> Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
8278,Whose neck shall I stand on to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ... <BR> Will you be still? <BR> And if you can't understand this you're a fool -- because you can't win this strike without me! You can't win anything without me!
8279,Jus' sassy that's all. <BR> Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! Ef some of us dies we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!
8280, <BR> Yeah good good good good good.  And They're <u>So</u> <u>Secret</u>...
8281,I tried to kill my wife. <BR> Don't you go to jail for that? <BR> I tried something like 30 times. There is as STARKS rightly figures no suitable response to that.
8282,He's got a gun.  Everyone he's got a <u>real</u> gun up here!  Real situation!  ... damn it... <BR> What are you doing? <BR> Nicholas this is fake.  It's all part of the game... <BR> Fuck you.
8283,What's he smoke in that? <BR> Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
8284,When my money moves I go with it. <BR> I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
8285,Trying to say something Martin? <BR> Hyatt... Friedmans... at the Hyatt... <BR> The Hyatt...? Whats that? <BR> Ho-hotel... Los Angeles... He...
8286,If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no again it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son! <BR> Commodus is just a young man he'll learn what you had to learn. <BR> It's not because he's young it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate. <BR> So I understand. <BR> Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type? <BR> You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man with you as his guide... <BR> A man should be upright not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir. <BR> Marcus you honor me but I'm a soldier politics scare the hell out of me. <BR> The Senators admire you. <BR> They fear me. <BR> They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one the Emperor the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic. <BR> I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.
8287, <BR> Which one of us? <BR> Oh both of you of course...
8288,All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter. <BR> Washed away. <BR> Because life is good. <BR> Because faith is rewarded.
8289,You wanted the truth -- now you have it. <BR> And the other one -- he is like you? <BR> He is immortal -- yes -- but he is not like me.  We are the last of our kind.  The last of the Calans.  I do not know what purpose we were put here for.  I only know that if he wins the world will suffer for it.
8290,Harry I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker-- <BR> --so? <BR> I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Miami.
8291,I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done! <BR> I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
8292,Larry swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls. <BR> Relax will you.
8293,Hey Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County... <BR> Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five... <BR> The Five? <BR> Just look for the really crowded road and follow that. <BR> Okay... oh umm would you mind if I borrowed some clothes? <BR> Huh? Sure look in my closet take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight right?
8294,You see it? <BR> Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was deader'n shit. Called it right in. <BR> This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him Wade?
8295,More money than you ever dreamed Roger. And the thing is no one gets hurt...how bout a beer? <BR> Too much to do...but I'll walk you out.
8296,I don't think you should... <BR> With what just happened upstairs --
8297,Hopefully no one. <BR> No one? Then why is Zero here?
8298,Your car's leaking either transmission or brake fluid.  I want you to have it checked ASAP at a gas station. <BR> You got it Dad.  I'll call you if I have a problem. <BR> I mean it.  Take care of it. <BR> I will Dad.  Bye luv you.
8299,Don't get excited Peter. They just asked a civil question. <BR> There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument? <BR> Well you don't have to lose your temper! <BR> You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you <BR> He didn't make a pass at me! I told you a million times!
8300,I'm sure. <BR> Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...? <BR> I think Walter would find this a little more than surprising.
8301,He's dead isn't he? <BR> Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this -- <BR> He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that? <BR> -- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here -- <BR> He came to kill us. <BR> -- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now -- <BR> You knew he was coming. <BR> No. <BR> I trusted you. <BR> You're wrong.  I didn't know. <BR> I don't trust anybody and I trusted you! <BR> I didn't know this would happen. <BR> He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us! <BR> And where is he now?  You believe what you want but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous. <BR> Oh Jesus... <BR> You stay -- if you want you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>. <BR> But the police -- <BR> -- there's no time -- <BR> -- we'll explain it -- <BR> -- how? -- <BR> -- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just -- <BR> -- forget it -- <BR> -- we'll tell them what happened -- <BR> I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here I'm never gonna find out!
8302,Man I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again. <BR> If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back. <BR> Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor.
8303,How are you Ellie?  Are you happy? <BR> Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it didn't we? <BR> You bet we did. <BR> It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement King. We'll never let up will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think do we? Just want to keep going. <BR> Whatever you say darling. <BR> I heard about your stunt. That's swell King. Just think of itthe groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo.  Come on King. You're lagging. 
8304,Go on! Get out of here while you can... <BR> Over there!
8305,If we were to go to trial would we win the case? <BR> Well of course it's always dangerous... <BR> I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win? <BR> Yes.
8306,So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon? <BR> Mrs. Mulwray? <BR> Yes Mr. Gittes? <BR> I don't want to drop it.
8307,Yeah well as I said Edgar ... <BR> You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours. <BR> The old queen did it on purpose.
8308,Dirty night. <BR> You have a vacancy? <BR> We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins twelve vacancies.  They moved away the highway. <BR> I thought I'd gotten off the main... <BR> I knew you must have. No one stops here anymore unless they do.
8309,Stearns Harrington you know who that is? <BR> Should I? <BR> A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm he's married everything's superb. Franky he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire some fuckin' place 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...? <BR> Yes. <BR> ...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns Harrington and he bought a dog and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns he tried to fix a case. <BR> The Big Boy did...? <BR> That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him he's going to the Judge to rat them out. <BR> Huh. <BR> Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering they throw him in jail he's gonna be disbarred his life is over.  Jimmy gimme another drink.  How are you? <BR> Me too. <BR> Okay. Now so he's in jail. He finally he gets to see the light he calls up Harrington he says he thinks he made a mistake. As if by magic charges against him are dropped he's released from jail.  P.S. He's fired from the firm his wife divorces him he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years.  You like that story?
8310,Not exactly.  She wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse.  Bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury I fail to see how you can afford such an adventure. <BR> I can see her if I want to.  I mean with half of France in the hands of the English what have I got to lose? <BR> The other half.
8311,I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum. <BR> Thanks.  Nice meeting you.
8312,Where are you going? <BR> Hunting. <BR> When? <BR> Sun up. <BR> Alone? <BR> No. <BR> Ramón -- you can't. <BR> Why not? I'm not needed here. <BR> But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad. <BR> Sure the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral. <BR> Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days. <BR> And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer? <BR> It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine. <BR> Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us and they know it. <BR> You mean you're ready to give up? <BR> Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
8313,You're lying. If it's over why are they after me? <BR> I don't know. <BR> Who sent you to Greece? <BR> A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new. <BR> Pamela Landy? <BR> I don't know who that is. <BR> What's going on in Berlin? <BR> I don't know! Why would I lie?
8314,Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink. <BR> Oh... yes.
8315,Mr. President this is St... <BR> Hi How are ya?  <u>Listen</u> to this willya...
8316,In Rome about three weeks ago.  I knew that one. <BR> A Roma circa tre settimane fa.
8317,"Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower? <BR> Anti-Shark cage. <BR> Who's inside, you or the shark?"
8318,I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence -- <BR> Working with? <BR> Agent Mulder.
8319,Excuse me ... Are you talking about recognizing China Mr. President? That would cost us our strongest support. <BR> No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials.
8320,So I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number and you're gonna be there right? <BR> I'll be there. <BR> And listen don't do anything else crazy okay? You all right? Okay. <BR> Bye.

Pick your poison.  Maybe he's in there to finish the job.  Maybe he's working for Wombosi.  Maybe they want to go on TV together.  Every possibility sucks -- we've got to move!
8323,I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today. <BR> Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse. <BR> And? <BR> And nothing.     He's just feeling us out. <BR> He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory. <BR> He sticks his toes in the water again we'll cut 'em off. <BR> Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property. <BR> I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
8324,Looks like we're it. <BR> More to the point. Where's our host?
8325,We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes pick some up for me... Grab some food now paper bag it we eat in the room. <BR> You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train? <BR> When they find it they find it.
8326,Lets go. <BR> I dont know what your problem is but... <BR> Right now your big friend at the Diplomat is bleeding fast Martin. He might still possibly survive if attended to soon. And he did cooperate.
8327,Stella I -- I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is. No wonder your husband's still in love with you. <BR> Police? <BR> Huh? <BR> You called the police? <BR> Oh. Well yes and no. It wasn't an official call. He's just a friend.  An old ornery friend.
8328,That's weird -- <BR> What? <BR> He looks different now burns are less extreme some of these wounds have closed up --
8329,Monsieur Rick may I get you a cup of coffee? <BR> No thanks Carl. <BR> Monsieur Rick!
8330,Those people were already dead. <BR> Before the bomb went off? <BR> That's what I'm saying.
8331,I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight? <BR> This isn't some 80's porno film you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies. <BR> Oh. Well. Maybe not yet. <BR> Not ever. Never.
8332,"Eve was incredibly modest. She insisted that no credit was due her, that Lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them. <BR> The implication being that I have not been reading them as written. <BR> To the best of my recollection, neither your name nor your performance entered the conversation."
8333,You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked. <BR> I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things but as for my revelations I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
8334,"You all right there? <BR> Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce? <BR> Um, yes."
8335,Vanessa. Shit you better get out of here. <BR> Why? What the big deal? <BR> Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.' <BR> I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
8336,'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...' <BR> ...one of the other nurses? <BR> Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand. <BR> All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.? <BR> What difference can that make...? All right...
8337,Mr. Berger the ring could I see it again? <BR> Yes Monsieur. <BR> A champagne cocktail please.

8341,Fuck it!  I think you better leave. <BR> I think so too.
8342,I am ready now... <BR> Just give me a moment and then you'll be free... <BR> I'm already free... <BR> Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
8343,Oh yeah? <BR> Now that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago. <BR> Oh yeah? <BR> You win!
8344,Hood residence. <BR> Charles what time is it? <BR> Is this Charles? <BR> What time is it? <BR> Um ten-o-five. Why? Where are you? <BR> I'm uh in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering because I know you're a very moral person and -- <BR> And? <BR> Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train. <BR> Right. <BR> What are you doing at home on a Friday night? <BR> I have plans.
8345,I'm into garbage. It's my thing. <BR> Boy this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.
8346, <BR> No it's fine. Thanks for making the call I guess.
8347,Come into the study a minute. <BR> Excuse me Mrs. Williams.
8348,Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy best in Chinatown... <BR> No thank you. <BR> You need to fill out those forms. Application psych-tests: M.M.P.I. and T.A.T.  For the financial questionnaire don't answer anything you don't feel like.  We'll run a T.R.W....
8349,Stow away? <BR> He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama. <BR> That is unfortunate.  We'll have to take him with us.
8350,Money? <BR> Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy. <BR> What does that mean?
8351,You wanna shoot me you little piece of shit? Take a shot! <BR> Fuck you White! I didn't create this situation I'm just dealin' with it. You're acting like a first- year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a professional. They get him they can get you they get you they get closer to me and that can't happen. And you you motherfucker are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I didn't tell him where I was from. I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him. Fuck fifteen minutes ago you almost told me your name. You buddy are stuck in a situation you created. So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere throw 'em at a mirror.
8352,Men sill give women flowers don't they? I mean as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date am I? <BR> No not at all --  except those are poisonous. <BR> WHAT!
8353,Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean c'mon Wade give me a break. <BR> See you tomorrow maybe. <BR> You okay? <BR> Yeah.
8354,Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl. <BR> Yeah? <BR> Oh yeah sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her. <BR> Thanks. <BR> Yeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a crush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in her mouth.
8355,Hey Cartman did they put that V-chip in your head or your ass? <BR> What's the difference?
8356,What the hell was that for? <BR> You're a pig. <BR> Why'd you hit me? <BR> Do you know how many different men I've had sex with? <BR> Do I get to hit you after you tell me? <BR> Three. <BR> Three? <BR> Three including you. <BR> You've only had sex with three different people? <BR> I'm not the pig you are. <BR> Who? <BR> You! <BR> No; who were the three besides me? <BR> John Franson and Rob Stanslyk. <BR> Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of. <BR> I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes. <BR> Animal vegetable or mineral. <BR> Vegetable meaning paraplegic. <BR> They put up the least amount of struggle. <BR> After dropping a bombshell like that you owe me. Big. <BR> All right. Name it. <BR> I want you to come with me on Monday. <BR> Where? <BR> To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment. <BR> Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up? <BR> It's important to me Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school. <BR> Jesus would you stop? You make my head hurt when you talk about this.
8357,Ramón ... listen for the love of God ... <BR> You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo yes ... but you ... <BR> Ramón ... listen to me ... I'm in a <BR> You Judas ... blood-sucker ... <BR> Ramón -- listen my kids ... <BR> Tú! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado! <BR> My kids don't have enough to eat! <BR> You think my kids have enough to eat you rat? <BR> I know it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go. <BR> You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
8358,Goddamn Gastro's killing me.  Making me blind. Hey Billy! <BR> Yeah. <BR> I got some acid man.  Maybe we can drop some on the guards huh? In their tea or something.
8359,Good. <BR> What is your name? <BR> Berger Norwegian and at your service sir.
8360,He ain't our guy John. <BR> Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
8361,Do you miss Cuba Manolo? <BR> Yes Mr. President. <BR> We let you down didn't we.  Your people. <BR> That was Mr. Kennedy. <BR> You don't think he was a hero?
8362,What exactly did they say? <BR> They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth. <BR> They didn't say an address? <BR> I told you what they said. <BR> Nothing else. <BR> Nothing. <BR> How'd they know who you were? <BR> They asked who it was. <BR> So they said more than the address. <BR> No. They asked who I was then told me what corner. <BR> This is bullshit man. <BR> What the fuck do you...
8363,I think I know where a CB is. <BR> Where's that? <BR> Upstairs.
8364,'Bout 4:30. <BR> Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up.
8365,What am I a method actor?  Hans babe put away the gun.  This is radio not television... <BR> That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis for Christ's sake tell him you don't mean shit to me -- <BR> John how can you say that after all these years--?  John?  John?
8366,I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed. <BR> You seem to know all about my destiny. <BR> I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know for instance that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame I I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca. <BR> You love her that much? <BR> Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause. Well I am also a human being.
8367,Your majesty I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap! <BR> My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion? <BR> Supposing she's an assassin? <BR> Tremoille I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?
8368,I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke.  <BR> Good luck! <BR> When I get back I'll have the cab waiting so be ready to go. <BR> Okay.
8369,... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and -- <BR> Jesus all right enough!
8370,Telly. <BR> Yeah. <BR> Did she suck your dick? <BR> A little bit. But I didn't really want her to. <BR> Why? <BR> I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy. <BR> It is right. <BR> I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick that's basic because there's nothing lost. <BR> It's no big deal right? <BR> Right. But when you deflower a girl that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it. <BR> Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame you know what I'm saying. It's like if you died tomorrow and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first. <BR> Yep. <BR> They're gonna tell their grand kids.  That Telly. He sure was good in the sack!
8371,What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal? <BR> Hey you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?
8372,No we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died. <BR> I nearly died when we split the bill. <BR> Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts. <BR> Then we should have had lunch at the bank.
8373,And what is your occupation Mr. McCord? <BR> Security consultant. <BR> Where? <BR> Government. Recently retired. <BR> Where in government? <BR> ...Central... Intelligence... Agency... <BR> Where? <BR> The C.I.A.
8374,Yeah my analyst thinks this move is keen for me. <BR> Yeah and I-I tru- you know I trust her because my-my analyst recommended her. <BR> Well why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway? <BR> Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is? <BR> What? <BR> We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right. <BR> Exactly but... exactly. Ooooh! <BR> You know I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know they could just break up and remain friends. <BR> Hey this one's mine this button. This one you rem- <BR> Yeah. <BR> I guess these are all yours. Impeach uh Eisenhower... Impeach Nixon... Impeach Lyndon Johnson... Impeach Ronald Reagan.
8375,I never intended to test you two to that extent but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you Ricky your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van. <BR> But Max -- <BR> We're square. <BR> Yes sir. <BR> And as for you Bobby you just moved up a notch. Your days of fighting for crumbs is through. Take a week off come back and we'll talk about the next thing.
8376,Clever of you to find this spot Betty. <BR> It pays to know your way around Oliver.
8377,Someone has seen her. Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars.  She is your girl friend isn't she? <BR> Sam they don't want to prosecute they just want the money back. It was all in cash... <BR> Casharoonie! <BR> Sam if she's here...
8378,-- the stained glass -- <BR> -- yeah we did that --
8379,Hey En nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver. <BR> Jennifer!  This is not - repeat not! how we do things in this family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!  Please - talk to me.  I promise to be reasonable.
8380,Hold me Don. <BR> Don?. Where is he? <BR> HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him! <BR> I promise Dorothy. I promise. <BR> Hold me. I'M FALLING!
8381,How long have you been married? <BR> Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh things are very bad there Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So Jan and I we we do not want our children to grow up in such a country. <BR> So you decided to go to America. <BR> Yes but we have not much money and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us. <BR> Yes I'll bet. <BR> He tells me he can give us an exit visa but we have no money. <BR> Does he know that? <BR> Oh yes. <BR> And he is still willing to give you a visa? <BR> Yes Monsieur. <BR> And you want to know -- <BR> -- Will he keep his word? <BR> He always has.
8382,Looking for me? <BR> Yes matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk. <BR> Satisfied with your cabin? <BR> Fine.
8383,Anna will be away at camp. The house will be quiet. It's better when it's quiet. <BR> Tell Annette I'm busy in July. <BR> C'mon Walter. <BR> You should see my appointment book. It got crazy. <BR> It's not what you think. <BR> Isn't it? <BR> The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk. She needs to see you and you need to see her. <BR> I'm not a monster. <BR> You're a good man Walter. Okay you did some wrong things but inside you're a good decent man. <BR> Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad and I'll always be bad. <BR> Don't talk like that.
8384,I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today Marv. <BR> Yeah where's your machine gun. <BR> Joke about it. I was up all night charting these stocks. You want to see this or what?
8385,Drive in. <BR> What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back. <BR> I don't want money.  I'm pulling back the curtain.  I'm here to meet the wizard.
8386,But you had to have it didn't you? It was so nice to listen <BR> I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
8387,You're still quite the boost Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ... <BR> And Tracy's on the move ...
8388,You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody. <BR>  <BR> You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person. <BR> I want to believe. <BR> If you believed you wouldn't be walking around with a handgun in your belt. What does that tell me? You want to make the night come down.
8389,Where to -- ? <BR> Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
8390,I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there. <BR> In where? <BR> [Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket.
8391,You know these fit... perfectly. <BR> They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace.
8392,You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband? <BR> Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
8393,Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about? <BR> What do you mean? <BR> Well ... if you don't remember anything I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything? <BR> Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it. <BR> How do you remember how to talk?
8394,...it doesn't matter.  The rest of it just didn't happen. <BR> What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her. <BR> Maternity ward huhh! <BR> We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN.  I'm crazy!  This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing?  My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything anymore.  Who are you? <BR> Who?  Me?...I don't know. <BR> What kind of answer is that? <BR> I don't know. <BR> You have to!....I'm 1138 THX Magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 Precinct 3 Residence:  Level 6421 Complex 12 Ramp 5.  Roommate 3417 LU...H. <BR> Oh That!  I'm 5555 SRT Entron.. <BR> I don't care.
8395,Please listen to me! *Both* of you... <BR> You forget yourself Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right?
8396,There's something I've been meaning to ask you Stephanie. <BR> Yeah. <BR> Where the hell is my car?
8397,So it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days. <BR> Yeah. Um I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.
8398,They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business. <BR> You havin' any luck findin' out who did him? <BR> Shane was a friend of yours? <BR> He was around... <BR> Lad I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin' throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand. <BR> When you're investigatin' how long ya keep at it? <BR> It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige. <BR> But if ya can't catch the guys...
8399,Can't.  History report.  The Normans and the Saxons. <BR> Bogutude.  Blow it off. <BR> I really can't.  Besides it's pretty interesting. <BR> You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously Cassandra there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework. <BR> Like what? <BR> Like my homework.
8400,Do we know what this says? <BR> Yup...  The main word there the file heading translates as: Treadstone. <BR> 
8401,There was an accident. I came here. <BR> I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry.   Are you all right?
8402,We just got a gold record. <BR> Do they have a show to give it to you? <BR> No  Hell some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box. <BR> Did it break? <BR> Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old. <BR> How long have you been together? <BR> Probably a little too long. <BR> Do you study at all? <BR> Depends on what I'm studying.
8403,And me? ... <BR> Firing you Mr. Helms wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job. <BR> And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know I work for only one president at a time. <BR> Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access. <BR> It will take a little time but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue. <BR> What? <BR> Mr. Castro. <BR> Yes. <BR> We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos. <BR> Well we'll lodge a formal protest. <BR> I don't think we can treat this as a formality.  Mr. Kennedy made a verbal promise to the Russians not to invade Cuba.  But you authorized Dr. Kissinger to put this in writing.
8404,All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go Mister? <BR> I'm not sure. <BR> Let me ask you that again. This time look around and consider your options.
8405,Zydowski.  It's about time. <BR> You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl. <BR> Yeah? <BR> Her prints belong to Stephanie Field convicted for soliciting two years ago. <BR> What?  Wait a minute - <BR> That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year. <BR> That's great Zydowski you tech guys are really on the ball.  Harding - call the print lab at the FBI run the prints through their library see if it's less screwed-up than ours...
8406,Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris? <BR> I tried to. <BR> It was on a Sunday wasn't it? <BR> I don't remember.  Maybe. <BR> Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day? <BR> I don't know... <BR> And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven? <BR>  <BR> That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
8407,We want him to come down to relax feel in control again. <BR> Poor boy has to work so hard.
8408,He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  Do you think he's coming from the sky? <BR> Perhaps... but wherever he comes from I think you should listen to him because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.
8409,After all maybe she just wants to apologize... <BR> I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
8410,So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo. <BR> He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him? <BR> Don't you think he's using you? <BR> Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.
8411,Don't be proud James. We're in Sewickley Heights. We could find you a nice golf course to barf on. <BR> No.
8412,You're referring of course to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President. <BR> Yes ...
8413,"When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit. <BR> I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that? <BR> The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but - <BR> Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon. <BR> You seem pretty sure of that. <BR> Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum."
8414,Mrs. Thorwald? <BR> Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.
8415,Brooks what's a perceptive fellow like you doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like. <BR> FBI? What you investigatin'? <BR> A murder. On the reservation. <BR> Again. Figures man.
8416,Come and dance with me Mr. Kringelein. <BR> I must speak to you Miss Flaemm -- business. <BR> Tomorrow morning. <BR> No -- now. <BR> Do you gentlemen know each other Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing -- Baron von Gaigern.
8417,We are virtually certain it isn't... <BR> Who's got the story?  <BR> Don't you want to know if it's true? <BR> What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a <u>story</u> and it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it -- How long've we got til it breaks?  <BR> Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow. <BR> Well yeah.  Now.  That's not good.  <u>Okay</u>:  <u>Okay</u>.  We'll set up the War Room <u>Here</u>...
8418,What about Bill? <BR> What about Bill? <BR> He's in love with you. <BR> More than anything in this world I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he? <BR> Why should he - and why should you? <BR> Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her worked with her loved her... but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what? <BR> Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you. <BR> Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often. <BR> Not to you. Not to Bill. <BR> Isn't that what they always say?
8419,Yeah Skip you wanted to see me? <BR> Crash shut the door.
8420,Robert.  Robert Muldoon my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist I'm afraid But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone. <BR> Alan Grant.  Tell me what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.
8421,Yes... Yes. You look... <BR> Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish? <BR> No. You look...
8422,Will we see you later? <BR> I can't later. <BR> And tomorrow? <BR> Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna? <BR> I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time? <BR> Ten thirty? <BR> We'll be there. <BR> Okay. Marge see you tomorrow.  It's really good to meet you.
8423,He's right. <BR> We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
8424,Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference so who cares? <BR> I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
8425,I'm interested in showing Jean's work. <BR> I really think you should talk to him about this.
8426,I don't even know how to live with myself. <BR> Just think about it. <BR> I've got problems. <BR> Who doesn't? <BR> Most people don't have my kind of problems. <BR> Guess that makes you pretty special. <BR> That's not what I meant.
8427,You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for we got fifty million bucks? <BR> So we get a little more for the boat. Besides the gold'll be safer where it is.
8428,Oh Christ don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here. <BR> Hey I heard all about it -- the parents the grandparents the China town thing -- and I believe you okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed.
8429,Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks. <BR> Oh don't go. <BR> I'm engaged for the evening. <BR> Oh can anyone engage you for the evening? <BR> To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing --  Goodbye you -- tomorrow at five o'clock. 
8430,Yeah but I don't like the idea of walking in on your jamboree . . . Just between you and methose things give me a stiff pain. <BR> You needn't see anybody. You can come directly to my study. I'd appreciate it very much if <BR> Nono. What the deuce do I want to
8431,[Beat] Yeah I'm fine. <BR> You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean you're normal-looking. [Resolutely for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve and I have a couch.
8432,How's it look Marge? <BR> Well he's got his gun on his hip there and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame. <BR> Yah. <BR> You haven't monkeyed with his car there have ya? <BR> No way.
8433,That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there. <BR> Hm. <BR> Can you see it?
8434, <BR> Anyone but Bernstein. <BR> Howard-- <BR> --remember Toronto Harry. <BR> That was awhile ago. <BR> I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him. <BR> I know I did but damnit Howard--  For the first time since I've known him I think he's really humping...
8435,In the name of God of St. Michael and St. George I make you a knight. Rise Sir... <BR> ...Perceval!

Hey what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Oh yeah really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it I mean did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it uh... <BR> It was just great! <BR> Oh humdinger. When- Well I got a wonderful idea. Why don'tcha get the guy who took you to the rock concert we'll call him and he can come over and kill the spider. You know it's a-
8437,No shit? <BR> Does anyone want another? <BR> You want another drink?
8438,Caesar I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here. <BR> Why?  'Cause you know him?
8439,Is everything okay at work? <BR> Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent. <BR> You're going to break up with Lisa aren't you? <BR> I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single successful guy. I think I want my freedom. <BR> Why? Because she won't sleep with you? <BR> Where did you hear that? <BR> I'm just guessing. <BR> Well... it's true. <BR> Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice Brad. Everybody loves Lisa. <BR> Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
8440,Ouch.. <BR> What's wrong? <BR> That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina. <BR> Do you still love her? <BR> Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her. <BR> Well have you asked her to come back?

8442,Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him Jeffrey. Jeffrey Jeffrey Jeffrey hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God. <BR> It's okay. it's okay. <BR> My secret lover.
8443,Shoot him. <BR> The American theater doesn't need people like that. <BR> Shoot him Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live? <BR> Keep going west. Last building before the river. <BR> How do you Eknow. <BR> Paisley Porter. <BR> What do you mean? <BR> About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who. <BR> Had to be him. <BR> She was very evasive.
8444,What's this? <BR> Turbine rotor's shot. <BR> I thought you said it was just a blade. <BR> Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal. <BR> How much longer's that gonna take? <BR> Like I always say -- <BR> I know I know two ways to do anything -- <BR> The right way and the wrong way. <BR> But how long? <BR> Hard to say. <BR> We gotta get outa here Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history. <BR> I'm telling you you don't want to be running that fan like it is. <BR> What about running number two by itself? <BR> It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it. <BR> How long then? <BR> I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- . <BR> How long? <BR> Three four days. <BR> Goddamit Dodge. <BR> What do you want me to tell you that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it skipper.
8445,Why not you -- Jean d'Aulon?  The only man who's poorer than I am and so the only man I can trust. Dignified honorable wise... what more could we ask of a king? <BR> My lord I'm not sure that...
8446,Why did you do that? <BR> To make a point.  I don't know her and I was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk.  I don't particularly like you so imagine what I'll do if you try anything...
8447,That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month Alvy. <BR> That place is four hundred dollars a month? <BR> Yes it is. <BR> It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction I'll pay for it. <BR> You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about. <BR> Hey don't be ridiculous.
8448,"The Halfords have invited us again this year. <BR> You want to go? <BR> What do you think? <BR> Well, it is a neighborhood tradition."
8449,Why did you come back? <BR> When I'm with you Sheila I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously. <BR> If Junior finds us he'll kill us both. <BR> I killed him once I'll just have to kill him again. <BR> You don't get two chances with Junior. <BR> At least I'll die smiling.
8450,Is that just beer? <BR> Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles by the way. <BR> I'm sure. Where is everyone? <BR> Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.
8451,Would you like something? Some coffee? <BR> Is anyone having this...?
8452,I'm sorry Mr. Basquiat. <BR> See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.
8453,Okay what happened? <BR> He's going to be all right right? <BR> No. He's dead. <BR> No way man. <BR> He's dead and there's nothing we can do. Come on Frank that's it.
8454,Where is my father? <BR> Where is the emperor and the army soldier?
8455,A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat.  Neighbors are watching for it. <BR> Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard...  maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
8456,So what's the deal? <BR> The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
8457,It's not? <BR> You gotta push the little yellow button...
8458,Have it your own way son but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat I'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come. <BR> You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First place you'd get hung and you know it. For another it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place.
8459,You come out here and talk to me you fucker! <BR> Will you stop it? You're drunk you're on drugs. You're gonna - <BR> I am not! <BR> You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that. <BR> Don't you threaten me! <BR> You'll wake the whole neighborhood! <BR> Don't you threaten me!
8460,When EVIL returns so shall we. <BR> We will be ready Lord.
8461,I can't do this. <BR> Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey don't I show you things Johnny U? <BR> Bodhi this is your wake up call man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!! <BR> Wild ain't it?!  See we exist on a higher plane you and I.  We make our own rules.  Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master?
8462,Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two. <BR> We need to hurry.
8463,Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better Albert. <BR> At this hour?
8464,Yeah?... I do? <BR> Sure you do. <BR> Well tell you what pal. If Ida wants to see me she can call me at my office.
8465,What? <BR> At the seven-eleven. <BR> Who? What are you talking about? <BR> They're on me. They're smoking me out! <BR> Nobody's smoking anybody out.
8466,<b>What if I don't wanna put out? That's all you ever say Relax put out I'm a living creature I have feelings too I don't need this abuse from you-</b> <BR> <b>Hey guy relax put out! You gotta relax shut your mouth- Baby I'd do anything for ya! Now don't make me smack you in the eye like last time-</b>

8468,You mean they weren't up here? <BR> No!  They're still on their way. <BR> That doesn't make any sense. <BR> Why? <BR> Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs.
8469,What?!  What's happening?!! <BR> You're officer of the watch George. <BR> I'm sorry Skip.  It's this damned book.  Lawford gave it to me.
8470,...How ya doin' there Scotty? <BR> Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom? <BR> It's okay Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.  These men they just want money see. <BR> What if - what if sumpn goes wrong? <BR> No no nothin's goin' wrong here. Grandad and I we're - we're makin' sure this gets handled right.
8471,Walked like a bastard... Skippin' stones and shit.. <BR> That's a good one Donny... <BR> I think so too --
8472,Went out before service. <BR> Have you two had breakfast?
8473,I see. <BR> But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized Monsieur underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come...
8474,Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess.  You want money right? <BR> A small loan would be welcome. More urgently I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.
8475,Wong? <BR> Fuck you wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale. <BR> Not wrong dumb ass Wong! You know like the Chinese name?
8476,Okay.  It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the gallery ... <BR> David I'm serious! <BR> I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days. <BR> Now what does that mean?  My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed and I'm supposed to think it's amusing?  That tie's God-awful.  Why do you wear it?
8477,My name is Rita. <BR> Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
8478,GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your hands up on your head. GO ON!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name?. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? <BR> Jeffrey. <BR> Jeffrey. Jeffrey what? <BR> Jeffrey nothing. <BR> You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment Jeffrey Beaumont? <BR> I wanted to see you. <BR> What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here? <BR> Nobody. <BR> Shit. You better tell me something. <BR> I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it. <BR> An experiment? Hey I've seen you before. <BR> I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you. <BR> Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME. <BR> . I saw you come in talk on the phone. get undressed. <BR> The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word. <BR> You said hello. to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone?. Don?. and little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. and something about a Meadow Lane. something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
8479,Do you mind if I sit? <BR> Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in... <BR> I'm tired.  I'm sorry I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance. <BR> Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk okay?  Be right back.
8480,It's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border.  It's time to tell the citizens everything.  Will you write it? <BR> Yes because I know they'll read it.
8481,Tripp! <BR> How are you Crabtree? <BR> Brimming. Say hello to my new friend Miss Antonia... uh...
8482,So do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day? <BR> You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises or do I keep my promises?
8483,That's okay you... we-we can walk to the curb from here. <BR> Don't be funny. <BR> You want your tennis stuff? <BR> Huh? Oh... yeah. <BR> You want your gear? Here you go.
8484,I said I want the truth. <BR> She's my sister and my daughter!
8485,Hard to say which is worse staying here or taking our chances in open water. <BR> If the weather holds it might not be so bad. <BR> It's not the weather I'm worried about. The wrong current could drag us as far as the Aleutians before we come across another boat.
8486,...Dad? <BR> Yah. <BR> Stan Grossman called. <BR> Yah okay. <BR> Twice. <BR> Okay. <BR> ...Is everything okay? <BR> Yah.
8487,Oh Ellen!  I've been wondering when you'd come.  Why don't you step in. <BR> Thank you.
8488,Who will it be? Put your mind to it then. <BR> Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you. <BR> Guenevere... <BR> You're not listening. Your heart is not. Love is deaf as well as blind.
8489,There was no blood man.  My brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you... <BR> God!  How old are you?  There ain't no bat.
8490,Come on Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate. <BR> I am... On Gina.  Fuck  I didn't think we were actually gonna do this. <BR> Concentrate on the ball. Shoot.
8491,One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife? <BR> Tell her you robbed a bank...
8492,Do you know what to do? <BR> I don't think he's breathing.
8493,God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt. <BR> Damn right! <BR> Oh but I forgot!  It was a Sunday... that explains it.  God's day off.
8494,Mr. President Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand. <BR> Son of a bitch. <BR> He says if he doesn't get it right away he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash he's been over the edge. <BR> Pay him.  Pay him what he wants.
8495,You know you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you? <BR> Figure you would have tried it already.
8496,I need to talk to you. <BR> That's funny. I need to talk to you too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room Professor Tripp. <BR> I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is. <BR> Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
8497,Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection. <BR> What? <BR> The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should... <BR> I tested positive? <BR> I'm sorry. <BR> But I only had sex with Telly.
8498,Better times. <BR> I was so... I been so... and then I saw you on TV and I remembered ya know... I always liked you... <BR> Well I always liked you Mike. <BR> I always liked ya so much... <BR> It's okay Mike - Should we get together another time ya think? <BR> No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you and...
8499,I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her. <BR> That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami  for the love of it? <BR> Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get. <BR> Oh she does huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't  I suppose. <BR> don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in <BR> If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 
8500,What are you doing here? <BR> I was lost. <BR> ...and you're not lost now? <BR> No I...
8501,You like the ponies? <BR> Sure. Yeah. <BR> You bet the ponies? <BR> Me? No. Not really. <BR> Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it? <BR> Why? <BR> It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze. <BR> This one? <BR> Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer stall whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today? <BR> Pshhh... <BR> A million. Easy. <BR> She was fast huh? <BR> Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing I don't remember some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip it meant the fix was in we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch the odds would drop so fast. <BR> That's why they call it the smart money.
8502,Well Stew that's all thrashed out. By golly I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all news is news. <BR> Sure sure. That's all right. That was a great story Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it. <BR> I gave you the breaks didn't I? That hairy chest story! <BR> You've raised it up to the chin I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
8503,Mom. <BR> Shh. <BR> I'm gonna go out for a little while. <BR> When are you gonna be back? <BR> Not too late. <BR> Four-thirty in the morning? <BR> Not too late.
8504,That's right. <BR> Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are by their very nature untrustworthy. <BR> That is so right. <BR> Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley? <BR> Now that's really stupid. <BR> So you see we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
8505,Rule number one: Don't get involved with patients. Rule number two: Don't get involved with patient's daughters. You understand? <BR> What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love. <BR> You don't know the first thing about rule number three cannot begin to understand the complexities of that rule. Come on let's go look at some hookers. The Kit Kat will be letting out.  Don't ever call a junkie whore a crackhead. They get real mad.
8506,What do you want? <BR> Shrimp and fries. <BR> I mean what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here. <BR> I need you to teach me. <BR> Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink? <BR> I'm serious. <BR> I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here your number's 37. <BR> Well I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
8507,I tried to warn you William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds. <BR> But you triple-dog-dared me. <BR> It was for your own good in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way.
8508,Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine. <BR> Medicine. As in medicine man?
8509,"Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes? <BR> I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day. <BR> Nice talk, Ben. Keep drinking. In between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool, some interesting words fall from your mouth."
8510,Wish I could take the credit but -- <BR> -- guess we know where Mr. Price is now. <BR> He must've beaten us all here!
8511,Thank you. <BR> May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée? <BR> I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when. <BR> Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley? <BR> I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends. <BR> Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse. <BR> It is a little coarse yes. <BR> Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San -- <BR> I have! <BR> You have yes. <BR> No I have and so has Miss Sherwood ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni. <BR> Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto. <BR> Absolutely. <BR> I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then? <BR> Tomorrow.
8512,Isn't there anyone that can stop him? <BR> Interestingly enough in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you Heather. <BR> Me?  Why me? <BR> Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy after all the first to humiliate and defeat him. <BR> That was Nancy not me! <BR> But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
8513,What does it matter who stays with the cop? We ain't lettin' him go. Not after he's seen everybody. You should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place. <BR> We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up. <BR> There is no fuckin' set up!  Look this is the news. Blondie you stay here and take care of them two. White and Pink come with me 'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you.
8514,Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy. <BR> I feel sure of it. <BR> I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you? <BR> She was ...
8515,What are you talking about? <BR> Must be getting old Stevie -- you're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in '94.  Girlie open up that casket there and see what you find.
8516,Poor Phillippe! <BR> The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice? <BR> All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal.
8517,Listen stupid could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval? <BR> Yes you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.
8518,"There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do - how does it go, groom? Something about the good they leave behind - I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre... <BR> You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre. <BR> You know why I forgive Eve? Because she's left good behind - the four of us, together like this, it's Eve's fault - I forgive her..."
8519,They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why?  Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us. <BR> What does arresting us get them? <BR> You wanna tell him?
8520,Do you know how to count? <BR> Of course I do?  Bring them up! <BR> Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers. <BR> But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me? <BR> He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now that's all he ever wanted... <BR> But my voices... they promised me... <BR> To hell with your voices -- it's time to face facts!  We have nothing to do here... none of us... not even you.  You should go home Jeanne.
8521,Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever <BR> To come? <BR> Yeah. I had sex with Jake and it took him like an hour and a half.
8522,And this guy is... <BR> Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant. <BR> Gustafson's accountant. <BR> Yah. <BR> But we still haven't found Gustafson. <BR> - looking. <BR> Sorry - didn't copy. <BR> Still missing. We're looking. <BR> Copy. And Lundegaard too. <BR> Yah. Where are ya Margie?
8523,"How? She's even forgot her own language! <BR> Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?"
8524,It's Marvosa - <BR> What do you need? <BR> The shit just hit the fan brother. That bitch has a partner and he got away from me.
8525,"I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk? <BR> Is that really what you want to ask me? <BR> Yes. <BR> Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either. <BR> Very clever."
8526,One of yours? <BR> No sir. <BR> If he's not a terrorist and he's not a hostage...he's just not part of the equation.
8527,Yeah somebody broke in and stole the samples one of those animal rights groups right?  I remember now they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike right? <BR> Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man. <BR> That's the guy?
8528,You don't have any!!! <BR> That's impossible. I've got like five of 'em!
8529,Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that we would have time to gather more before -- <BR> Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied that will do.
8530,First we're flying -- now we're sinking! <BR> Well come on!
8531,It was in her favorite handbag -- And Mr. Doyle that can lead to only one conclusion. <BR> Namely?
8532,Yes <BR> I did not accept any.  I...  I wanted... to.  But I didn't. You know I didn't.  Don't you?
8533,The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18. <BR> I don't know what's weirder the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
8534,Still after Jimmy? <BR> They found prints at Blue Legs' place. <BR> Yeah. Jimmy's prints are there. But they cross over Benjamin Black Star's prints. And he wasn't there until six o'clock the mornin' after to get eggs from the chickens. So Jimmy wasn't there til the next day. Follow?
8535,Louis please -- ! <BR> My guards are useless!  Take her from me!
8536,You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting. <BR> I had to arrange about the trip. <BR> You're sweet. <BR> You think so?
8537,You mean get off my own land? <BR> Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
8538,How many? <BR> Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded. <BR> Jesus Christ! <BR>  <BR> Shit the press doesn't care about the facts.  Cronkite's sticking it to me. It's their first big hit on Richard Nixon.
8539,Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is there's only one solution.  Termination. <BR> Anyone particular in mind? <BR> You.
8540,What's the matter? <BR> Oh Peter  <BR> What's got into you? <BR> Oh Peter! I was so scared.
8541,And she always had such spirit! But after her mother died... <BR> Would you say she was ambitious? <BR> Oh there's no tellin' what that girl could've accomplished and she never had it easy. Never really had a childhood... caring for her father going to school.
8542,Know what? <BR> Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn. <BR> Learn what?
8543,So what do we do? <BR> We go and hang out with the dude make him happy drink some tea whatever it takes until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop go home to California. <BR> Where is this happening? <BR> We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.
8544,You know Bill is really mad at you. <BR> Oh? <BR> I mean... <BR> Mary?
8545,So we'll meet him then? <BR> What? Oh yeah sure if you want. I tell you every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire while I aroused and inflamed --'
8546,What's the matter? Something I et no doubt. Egg marks the spot <BR> You ought to get some new ties Stewart. <BR> I don't need any new ties. I've got another tie - I've got another one besides this one. And it's a pip too. There's only one thing wrong with it. You know what that is?  It has a little weakness for gravy and once in a while it leans a little toward ketchup. Of course that's only in its weaker moments. When you move down to my place I'll show it to you.
8547,Fine as long as you don't serve chicken that way. <BR> Tell me. What do the police say? <BR> They're calling it an accident. <BR> Who's the investigating officer? <BR> Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant. <BR> Do you know him? <BR> Oh yes. <BR> Where from? <BR> We worked in Chinatown together. <BR> Would you call him a capable man? <BR> Very. <BR> Honest? <BR> Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do. <BR> Of course but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case? <BR> None. <BR> That's too bad. <BR> Too bad? <BR> It disturbs me Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking of course. How much are you charging her? <BR> My usual fee plus a bonus if I come up with any results. <BR> Are you sleeping with her? Come come Mr. Gittes. You don't have to think about that to remember do you?
8548,But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected? <BR> Oh baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
8549,Whose car? <BR> My car! My car! Tan Ciera! <BR> Don't go in! Wait for back-up!
8550,I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed.  I do dark ops. <BR> Dark ops? <BR> Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination. <BR> Very ugly. <BR> It is at that. <BR> Not very zen of you huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all. <BR> I never made that claim. <BR> I know.  Jean-Pierre did. <BR> You were behind the door? <BR> I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to. <BR> You would have done that? <BR> I would have tried not to.  But yes if it would have kept him from shooting you I would have. <BR> How could you have done that? <BR> Because I owe you.  Look at that...
8551,Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying? <BR> Yeah watch where you walk dukes. <BR> What? <BR> Nuffin' G. Just forget it. <BR> What the fuck yo? You wanna catch a beat down?

8553,Come on. It'll be fun. We'll just bug out. There should be a bunch of people. It'll be fun I promise. <BR> Yeah? <BR> Yeah. It'll be nice. It'll be a change of pace. That club shit gets boring.
8554,You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project. <BR> How? <BR> The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not. <BR> What alien environment? <BR> Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future. <BR> What about you? <BR> My life is over.  Go.
8555,Ma... all this will it hurt the baby? <BR> Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy. <BR> Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside. <BR> Well can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow. <BR> But will it--hurt the baby? <BR> They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it. <BR> You don't ever get scairt do you Ma? <BR> Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it. <BR> Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think? <BR> No. No it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They'd all get upset if I done anymore 'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that.  That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together.
8556,John: gimme a cuesta-ray. <BR> Oh shit what's today? <BR> Today is Tuesday. What? <BR> I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have? <BR> Give 'em a box of Macanudos. <BR> Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's I can't make it.
8557,Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me... <BR> You might have doubted for say five minutes or so Sister.
8558,Say Shep how ya doin' there? <BR> Mm. <BR> Say ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with up there in Fargo? <BR> Put you in touch with Grimsrud. <BR> Well yah but he had a buddy there. He uh - <BR> Well I don't vouch for him. <BR> Well that's okay I just - <BR> I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy? <BR> Carl somethin'? <BR> Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him. <BR> Well that's okay he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for so I'm not worryin'. I just I was wonderin' see I gotta get in touch with 'em for I might not need it anymore sumpn's happenin' see - <BR> Call 'em up. <BR> Yah well see I did that and I haven't been able to get 'em so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya. <BR> Nope.
8559,Now...now I'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  It's just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me. <BR> What?...Oh no THX.  That's not true.  Not satisfied?  THX I need you so much.
8560,Dude we don't have watches. <BR> Sheet.  Did you bring ze mirror?
8561,The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news -- <BR> Just tell me when you'll have it fixed. <BR> -- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that Wade. <BR> Yeah. I know about that. <BR> LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it? <BR> Tell me. <BR> Chub says you're fired. <BR> He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning. <BR> He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
8562,Jesus man ... What'd you do? <BR>  <BR> Are you crazy? You throw down with The Carpenter? You got a grudge against your life?
8563,All right everybody! That's ten minutes! <BR> No! Let me try this!
8564,I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school-- <BR> Yes--? <BR> I want to know what he told you last night. <BR> I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination. <BR> Did you believe what he told you?  I have a reason for asking this -- a very important reason.
8565,Call me as soon as you get him. <BR> Leave your phone on the hook.
8566,Oh? <BR> It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed. <BR> I'm sorry Sara. I've been trying to tell you. It's all my --
8567,You can tell by the intonation. <BR> One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?
8568,You're quiet at work. <BR> I'm just quiet. <BR> You don't hang out with the other guys. <BR> Neither do you. <BR> They're all assholes.
8569,Really? <BR> Yeah I haven't figured out the plot yet but it's laid in a Siberian village. <BR> You're a bit eccentric aren't you? <BR> Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world me. Only one thing wrong with me <BR> You don't wear garters!
8570,No you didn't Frank thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift. <BR> I need a drink that's all.
8571,Anything? <BR> No. Munich's a bust. He's loose. <BR> Are we locked up?
8572,Right after we played backgammon. <BR> We played backgammon? <BR> Uh huh. You beat me three times. <BR> I did? <BR> Yep. Then I fucked your daughter. <BR> Excuse me?
8573,Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is. <BR> Oh excuse me. 
8574,Actually no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void.  Now he did have a pension account worth another 150 thousand. <BR> Well oh... <BR> And a house. Valued at 350 thousand. <BR> So where's that leave us?
8575,The King without his sword the land without a king... <BR> We are to blame.
8576,Sophie. <BR> Yes Mr. Gittes. <BR> Get me the Times. Whitey Mehrholtz.  And how about that snotty broad?  What does she think she's perfect? Coming in waving her lawyers and her money at me  so goddam smug. She's no better than anybody else in this town.
8577,Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house? <BR> That-that wont do. Thats not the way it goes. You saw it you tell it thats the way... <BR> Im finished here and Im tired Emily. You shouldnt be here. Now dont make it worse. <BR> A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think Ill get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever itll be too late. <BR> Then find another way. <BR> Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For gods sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
8578,It's the only logical conclusion. If he remains here he'll be as dead as... <BR> -- as we will be. <BR> Lara please... <BR> But why Earth Jor-El. They're practically animals. <BR> They are primitive Lara but they are not animals. <BR> A million years behind us.  Jor-El he's only a baby. <BR> Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them. <BR> He'll be weightless. <BR> Yes true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat cold no life no life support systems...No Lara believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure he will also be strong.  He will be fast He will be virtually invulnerable. <BR> He will be odd different. <BR> Well physiologically he...
8579,I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father. <BR> It would help if you were married if there was someone at home while you work. <BR> I plan to. Soon. <BR> How soon? <BR> This spring. <BR> Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child. <BR> It looks pretty hopeless don't it? <BR> No not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill right? <BR> Yes. <BR> Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it. <BR> Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost? <BR> Hard to say. If we go for custody depositions psychiatric evaluations it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn assuming they're unduly restrictive it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred. <BR> Oh. <BR> You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the -- <BR> Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter.  I'll send you the five hundred.
8580,Boy am I glad to see you. <BR> What are you doing here? <BR> We have to talk. <BR> Your painful groin?
8581,Damon Bradley... <BR> Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
8582,What are you doing? <BR> It's a long story.  You know I think that Ellis has his eye on you. <BR> That's okay...  ... I have an eye on his private bathroom.
8583,No... How? <BR> The Telegraph office. <BR> But we were so careful. <BR> We pushed it. We got lazy.
8584,Sandy you have to chill out at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us. <BR> There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
8585,I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs -- <BR> Transplants? <BR> -- and an America's Cup Trials... <BR> I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking. <BR> And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White. <BR> Are you now. I know about porkers in the water --  Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
8586,According to my nava-computer the -- <BR> Shut up!  Just shut up you idiot!! <BR> Sheriff this is no time to panic. <BR> This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost Andy is gone they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!! <BR> My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place -- <BR> Oh yeah?  Well if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me -- <BR> Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy. <BR> WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
8587,Oh God... <BR> Yep.  Well we started it he Ended it...
8588,You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room. <BR> I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
8589,Oh really? What's the verdict? <BR> I sort of like it. I mean it's cute. <BR> Cute? <BR> Well when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison. <BR> I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point. <BR> Consider it your musical education. <BR> I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me. <BR> Okay stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi. <BR> Go learn something.
8590,Sorry. <BR> Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero? <BR> Yeah.  What's your theory? <BR> The fucking punks are surfers.
8591,Dr. Thompson just so the Jury knows you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct? <BR> That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion. <BR> Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today? <BR> Just as you are Sir... <BR> Are you board-certified in anesthesiology Doctor? <BR> No I am not. It's quite common in New York State... <BR> ...I'm sure it is but this is Massachusetts Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine? <BR> No. <BR> Neurology? <BR> No. <BR> Orthopedics? <BR> I'm just an M.D. <BR> Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...? <BR> I know of him. <BR> How is that? <BR> Through through his book. <BR> What book is that? <BR> Meth... Methodology and Technique... <BR> ...of Anesthesiology? <BR> 'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes. <BR> How old are you? <BR> I am seventy-four years old. <BR> Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine? <BR> I'm on the staff of... <BR> Yes we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You you're available for that? When you're paid to be there? <BR> Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case I am available. I am seventy-four years old I am not board-certified. <BR> I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done. <BR> Do you indeed. I'll bet you do. Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the time. We will admit the Doctor as an 'expert witness' fine.
8592,Who's your parole officer? <BR> A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti. <BR> How is he? <BR> Fuckin' asshole won't let me leave the halfway house. <BR> Never ceases to amaze me. Fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there slits some old woman's throat for twenty- five cents. Fuckin' nigger gets Doris Day as a parole officer. But a good fella like you gets stuck with a ball-bustin' prick.
8593,God that feels so fucking good. Take yours off. <BR> I'm fine. <BR> Yeah? Well have a seat anyway.
8594,Ray. Ray don't let go now Man. Ray... <BR> You go to the council fire. I'm going back in. <BR> Ray.
8595,How do you know? <BR> I've seen enough phoney ID's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune.  Add all that up and I don't know what the fuck it means but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay.
8596,So where are we going? <BR> Wherever you like Lutece 21 the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite.
8597,"What's the point with hooks and Lines? -- <BR> Don't tell me my business!  Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle."
8598,The Ł1000 is on account. <BR> My rates... <BR> We are aware of your rates Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return need I say it again we expect discretion and undivided attention. <BR> Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography Mrs Spitz? <BR> Ha... No Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate.
8599,I do. I need a new sponsor. <BR> Is that what you want? <BR> Yeah. <BR> A sponsor. <BR> Yeah. <BR> Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore.

8600,Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back. <BR> I'm sorry for upsetting you [beat] but I'm not lying to you. <BR> You can't be William Starks. He's dead. <BR> [Beat] What? <BR> William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave. <BR> [Beat] What? <BR> His body was found New Year's Day 19...1993. At Alpine...
8601,Sup then? Sup? <BR> Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
8602,Jesus...  Look James you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However I think it's best if for the moment at least  ...we abstain. <BR> You're mad at me aren't you? <BR> What? <BR> You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog. <BR> It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's --  Who said anything about girlfriend?
8603,Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair Mrs. Peel. Any idea who? <BR> No idea who. No idea why ... <BR> Teddy bears cuckoo clocks toys All children's things ... <BR> ... Or grown-ups who still like to be children. <BR> Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies? <BR> Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
8604,You don't mean that. <BR> Yeah. I mean that. <BR> No you don't. You're pissed that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you. <BR> The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing this divorce thing rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody especially not kids. And I pay her.
8605,Get up out of the chair Richard. <BR> What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through man. <BR> Get up out of the chair and walk toward the backdoor Richard. <BR> I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you! <BR> Get up!
8606,Goddamn it Sean you listen to me or I will kick your ass do you hear me? <BR> Listen to Andy Sean. <BR> We're throwing a rope and you better catch it hear?
8607,Where is she? What is she doing? How old -- <BR> Not so fast. <BR> Sorry.  Where is she? <BR> In my bedroom sleeping. <BR> Where? <BR> In my bed Rosen. Where do you think? <BR> Where are you? <BR> In my bed too. <BR> How old are you and your sister? <BR> We're little kids. <BR> But roughly how old? <BR> I'm maybe about six... which would make her four.
8608,This is terrible! This can't be happening!! <BR> We HAVE to see this movie dude!
8609, <BR> Well personally Major I will take what comes. <BR> Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially of course.

This's Pennies from <u>Heaven</u>... on his triumphal return home Old Shoe his Plane Forced Down...AND YET... <BR> He's supposed to be flying in from Europe. <BR> We'll deal with that when we come to it.  <u>This</u> is producing.  <u>This</u> is what they pay off on...come on Pal Boots and Saddles...

I thought they stole it. <BR> Sold it stole it whatever... <BR> Motherfucker... <BR> Oh give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy. <BR> You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you. <BR> Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that. <BR> You just don't fucking get it do you? <BR> You know he fucks all his girls don't you? <BR> What the fuck is that supposed -- <BR> I mean that's what I heard -- <BR> You got something to say --
8616,"Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach? <BR> Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught... <BR> Something else. Do most attacks go unreported? <BR> About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims. <BR> There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh... <BR> Rogue? <BR> Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts? <BR> It's called Territoriality. It's a theory. <BR> And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing? <BR> You could say that."
8617,Anyone else want one? Rolfe? <BR> No thanks. I don't drink. <BR> Yeah. I forgot.
8618,Listen Hannah I'm flattered really but right now I -- <BR> Tripp where the hell...
8619,My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked... <BR> Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
8620,Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal like us. <BR> And if he's not? <BR> Then we're all in a lot of trouble.
8621,This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven. <BR> This is the only American car you've ever driven.
8622,Look Frank when I say don't answer it that means answer it.  You can do that for me at least.  Three Zebra. <BR> Yes Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk the king of stink our most frequent flier Mr. Oh. <BR> Ten-four.  Don't go. Not this time.
8623,Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case. <BR> No Lisa -- I don't think he did.
8624,Easy there. <BR> I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't know how anyone actually walks in these things.
8625,No not yet. <BR> Too busy playin' ball huh? <BR> Nah I gave it up.
8626,Are we understood? <BR> You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people dont just provide little kids and videotapes Mrs De Moraes. Theyre in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise. <BR> Huh! Really? Hotels? <BR> The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.
8627,Shut up! <BR> She knows it was our fault! <BR> Keep your mouth shut Keitel! <BR> No! It's YOU Loki! I should never have listened to you!
8628,I mean Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that. <BR> Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place. <BR> So I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place? <BR> You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
8629,How high up would you say that is? <BR> I'd say about thirty feet sir. <BR> You know if you cut your bathroom in half you'd have my apartment. <BR> Which bathroom is that sir? <BR> The small one.
8630,Go ahead. Just make it quick. <BR> Totally. <BR> It's the first door on your left.
8631,Houston I think we may have a problem. <BR> Evelyn go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
8632,I was so goddamn close Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand... <BR> Keep tasting...
8633,I'm just trying to place you. <BR> I've lived all over the world.
8634,That's why the boltcutter. <BR> What's that? <BR> He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door? <BR> Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed. <BR> You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered? <BR> He had to.
8635,Alright where is she? <BR> And who are you? <BR> Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car! <BR> I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
8636,I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple. <BR> Ohhhh... You don't mean that. <BR> I don't but... I do. It's just... I love you Bruce. I don't want you to... <BR> Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?
8637,I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through. <BR> Maybe plans changed... <BR> Plans don't change...
8638,It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something. <BR> No I mean I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably. <BR> Oh. So...
8639,After all your posturing all your speeches...you're nothing but a common thief. <BR> I'm an exceptional thief Mrs. McClane. And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping you should be more polite.
8640,Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it. <BR> Hey take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
8641,The Red Dragon. <BR> Shut it man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him through an Austrian passbook account. <BR> So we're talking money laundering... <BR> Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
8642,Here. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it greedy bitch.  Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want. <BR> I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too!
8643,Which one is yours - the big one? <BR> Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve. <BR> I quite agree.  Tell me who runs up that flat - your wife? <BR> No my flag steward. <BR> And who mixes the cocktails - your wife? <BR> No my cocktail steward.  Look if you're interested in whether I'm married or not - <BR> I'm not interested at all. <BR> Well I'm not. <BR> That's very interesting.
8644,Any progress? <BR> Some. It's been slow -- <BR> You don't look so good. <BR> I'm just tired that's all. We've been up all night.
8645,But he's OK. If he wasn't OK he wouldn't be here. Okay let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again at the risk of being redundant if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name...  ...you won't want to be you. Okay quickly.  Mr. Brown Mr. White Mr. Blonde Mr. Blue Mr. Orange and Mr. Pink. <BR> Why am I Mr. Pink? <BR> Cause you're a faggot alright?
8646,I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful. <BR> I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing? <BR> What -- what sort of action do you mean? <BR> Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.  Leveling the island of Manhattan perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.
8647,The fact is that the milk has been spilled and now we need you to tell us how to clean it up. <BR> Cleaned up?  It can't be cleaned up! Without the nanobot the waste can't be stabilized!  That's what we've been trying to tell you!  The only thing we can do is run!  Run!  Run!
8648,Now look what you did! <BR> I saved your life is what I did! <BR> Who asked you to!
8649,What? What is that? <BR> She called you didn't she? <BR> Oh be real! Would you... Would you please hug me?  I just went through a very traumatic experience and I haven't been having the best day so far. Now come on.
8650,Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here? <BR> Everything is A-okay but I've gotta get that sandwich!
8651,Where'd he go yesterday? <BR> Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower and the Pig 'n Whistle. <BR> Jesus Christ this guy's really got water on the brain. <BR> What'd you expect? That's his job. <BR> Listen we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something. <BR> I think I got something. <BR> Oh yeah? You pick up the watch? <BR> It's on your desk. Say you hear the one about the guy who goes to the North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking for penguins?
8652,So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks? <BR> We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift remember?
8653,Yes sir. <BR> Awright. An' if she gets outa han' I'll be in the right han' corner this side the dance floor. <BR> Ain't gonna get outa han'.
8654,Bet he is Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man. <BR> 
8655,Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah I'll hold. <BR> Who's up for making some real money?
8656,What do you want to do? <BR> I'm doing it. <BR> Are you a bad boy? <BR> Whatiya mean? <BR> Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything. <BR> What do you want? <BR> I want you to hurt me. <BR> No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
8657,Would it be possible to use it for military purposes? <BR> Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
8658,But he's the head of InGen! <BR> You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else?
8659,All right then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars payable in -- <BR> Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one. <BR> Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect. <BR> Goddammit I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
8660,Quick -- Mr. Kringelein. <BR> Oh -- what -- what -- 
8661,If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal a big job fame money -- <BR> All the things I hate.
8662,Did you hear that? <BR> Yeah but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood.
8663,Frank...what's wrong? <BR> Nothing.  I just wanted to see you.
8664,-- his life? <BR> I don't know. <BR> Well I recommend knowing before speaking. The law leaves much room for interpretation -- but very little for self-doubt.
8665,You all right? <BR> My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids John.  Tuberculosis got him. <BR> It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids too.  They panicked. <BR> They were throwing rocks John just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality. <BR> You're doing the right thing Dick ... don't let 'em shake you. <BR> It broke my heart when Harold died. <BR> That was a long time ago.
8666,Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie -- <BR> Three. <BR> Well they'd be very stylish in Finland -- just before you froze to death. Begin to get the idea?
8667,You drive a hard bargain Mr Lombard. <BR> You do want me to keep the job dont you Mrs De Moraes?
8668,When you're here in the city where do you live? <BR> Dark and large.  With vines -- no not vines.  Not alive.
8669,I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was.  Think it might be anything? <BR> This?  Naw...
8670,You gonna carry that around all night? <BR> Yeah... I'll paint on it.
8671,Time to wake up.  Hey kid time to wake up.  Rashid!  Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over. <BR> What time is it? <BR> Eight-thirty. <BR> Eight-thirty? <BR> You'll find juice and eggs and milk in the refrigerator. Cereal in the cupboard. Coffee on the stove. Take whatever you want. But it's time for me to get started in here.
8672,No. <BR> I don't mind. <BR> You should go home. <BR> Can't I stay a little longer? <BR> It's getting dark. Go home. <BR> Will I see you again?
8673,Nothing that we can do can make that woman well. <BR> And no one will know the truth. <BR> What is the truth? <BR> That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life she's in a coma her life is gone. She has no family she has no home she's tied to a machine she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors and you and me have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money.  I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.  I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.  I can't do it. I can't take it.
8674,Don't you gamble? <BR> Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.
8675,Same as always -- glub-glub bubble-bubble stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean. <BR> Shells and lobsters and stuff? <BR> Mostly old garbage.  Today we found a '48 Hudson.
8676,What's that? <BR> I think I'm losing you. <BR> No wait don't go! <BR> It's okay.  I'm still here Chief. <BR> But you're not...you're not still here.
8677,Cut it out Pa. He'p Al with the truck.  Don't fret honey. You goin' to be awright. <BR> Tom I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live. <BR> Maybe he'll be back. We'll leave word for him. Jus' don't cry. 
8678, <BR> I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya Noah. Howya Uncle John.
8679,Not her mouth...  I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon. <BR> What's wrong with you?
8680,What is this? <BR> Magic potion.  You should try a little. <BR> Oh no. <BR> It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm. <BR> Really? <BR> Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue. <BR> Will I go crazy or something? <BR> No no it calms you makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer but in a fraction of the time. <BR> Why not then?
8681,What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for? <BR> Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story the Post stock has dropped what 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you. <BR> You think she wants us to ease up on the story? <BR> I don't know but I don't think that's unreasonable either do you?
8682,Don't this place look like home? <BR> It look nicer then home! <BR> What have you two been doin' to make it look so nice?
8683,He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign. <BR> You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
8684,'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him the clever tit sneaking looks at it late at night talking to it. <BR> Yeah? Where?
8685,I remember that. Five or six years ago. <BR> Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton. <BR> Near Carvel? <BR> I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
8686,That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to... <BR> Bates never denied Mary was here. <BR> Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money. <BR> Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it? <BR> Sam that old woman whoever she is. I think she told Arbogast something! And I want her to tell us the same thing!
8687,I think it's fine? <BR> It's not too <u>clean</u>... <BR> No it's...  I'll yes I'm holding but...  No it's ...
8688,Merlin the powers of Summoning the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me! <BR> I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you and I will have you.
8689,Don't get me wrong. I don't care. But the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do. <BR>  <BR> That didn't sound very convincing.
8690,Where will you be? <BR> Waiting in the apartment next door.
8691,I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?! <BR> It's all the same thing.
8692,Hello Marge. <BR> Tom you startled me! You're back. <BR> How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well? <BR> Yes -- I'm on a good streak thanks. <BR> I was just looking at you --  so quiet. <BR> Where's Dickie? <BR> I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days. <BR> Ha. Did he say why? <BR> I don't know. I don't understand Dickie Marge so your guess is as good as mine. <BR> What does that mean? <BR> Well one day I'm invited skiing the next day I'm not one day we're all one family the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me. <BR> Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone? <BR> He was thinking of you Marge -- he asked me to deliver this.
8693,Where is the money? <BR> Don't tell him -- <BR> Shut up Violet! <BR> He can't kill you --
8694,If there is one thing I admire it's a girl with a shapely ankle. <BR> Me too.  Bye now. <BR> Let me carry one of the instruments. <BR> Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart?
8695,This is her roommate.  Daphne can't talk right now.  Is it anything urgent? <BR> Well it is to me.  Will you give her a message?  I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight. <BR> Got it.  Supper - yacht - after the show - I'll tell her.  Your yacht?
8696,Continue. <BR> Sire we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me. <BR> ... The ball... Continue. <BR> I must insist Sire.
8697,I'm not hungry. <BR> Well it's fixed so you'll have to eat it.
8698,No.  We can't risk it. <BR> Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him. <BR> This doesn't go upstairs.
8699,"How... how was Miss Caswell? <BR> Frankly, I don't remember. <BR> Just slipped your mind. <BR> Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick. <BR> Was she that bad?"
8700,Dad I'm going to jail and you know it. <BR> Maybe that's the price Bud maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life create don't live off the buying and selling of others...
8701,You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are?  Who do you think you are...? <BR> Hold on a second. <BR> I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did? Do you know what you did?
8702,B.B. It's me  Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year? <BR> I didn't see you. <BR> What do you mean? <BR> You haven't heard? Andy's dead.
8703,No thanks. We're not hungry. <BR> Oh I see young people in love are never hungry. <BR> No. <BR> 
8704,Juno! God you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong? <BR> Nothing... <BR> Then what's going on? <BR> I went to the doctor today.
8705,Legally she can't take that stuff. Legally she can't take the stuff. <BR> No Ace. <BR> Half of everything is mine. <BR> Ace listen to me. <BR> Half - I'm comin' down. 
8706,...Jagger was here...I was here... <BR> You don't give a shit about anything do you? <BR> Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed. <BR> That's it? That's all you give a shit about? <BR> Oh yeah...and that my stich job doesn't make you uglier than you already are...this won't hurt a bit...
8707,Man that's great. That's just great. <BR> You catch Dylan? <BR> Me? No no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis. <BR> You have a raccoon? <BR> Tsch a few. <BR> The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid. <BR> I can think of another word. <BR> He's God! I mean this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment. <BR> Really? It must be a tremendous hem. <BR> I'm a Rosicrucian myself. <BR> Are you? <BR> Yeah. <BR> I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room. <BR> It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy remember? <BR> Yeah were yuh? I was-I was at an Alice Cooper thing where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes.
8708,Turn 'em up. <BR> Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I win don't I -- 
8709,"Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way. <BR> Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?"
8710,Galvin look many years ago... <BR> And don't give me this shit 'I was a lawyer too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are. <BR> Are you done? <BR> Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass. <BR> You aren't going to get a mistrial boy. We're going back this afternoon we're going to try this case to an end. Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail.
8711,I thought they weren't meeting him at the airport... <BR> They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport.  I told'em they're wrong I can't convince'em. They're concerned that the last kid had the <u>Wheat</u>. Variations include the kid is a <u>boy</u> the kid is <u>twins</u> it's a little <u>dog</u> ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff the dog runs to him... <BR> Uh...

8715,Who do you think sent me? <BR> I know who sent you.  I don't know why.  I learned many many things from the CIA.  <u>Many</u> things.  I learned the way they think.  Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?
8716,Please! <BR> Sorry I got you up boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah be glad to.  Said to give you his regards.
8717,When are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! Come on. Let's get out of here. <BR> But I just bought a good blanket. <BR> Forget it...
8718,Jesus Christ! <BR> You can do some crazy things with it.
8719,Jeff -- if you could only see yourself. <BR> Now Lisa -- <BR> Sitting around looking out a window to kill time is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with with binoculars and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is is diseased! <BR> Do you think I consider this recreation? <BR> I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it I'm getting out of here. <BR> You'd better before you catch the disease! <BR> What is it you're looking for? <BR> I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman? <BR> What makes you think something's wrong with her? <BR> A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day. <BR> Maybe she died. <BR> Where's the doctor -- the undertakers? <BR> She could be under sedatives sleeping.  He's in the room now.
8720,Hey hey aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil? <BR>  <BR> All right let it go. <BR> 
8721,I'm talkin' about your potential. <BR> Uh-huh. <BR> You're not a C student. <BR> Uhn. <BR> And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me. <BR> Uh-huh. <BR> You know what a disparity is? <BR> Yeah! <BR> Okay. Well that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey. <BR> Oh man!
8722,You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise. <BR> Do you care about me? <BR> Of course I do.
8723,Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy the boys can't make her happy she just doesn't -- <BR> Jim maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city. <BR> Jesus let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that honestly -- <BR> Well we can talk about it. <BR> That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way. <BR> Maybe you just need -- look can you wait here a sec I need to tidy up -- just a minute I'll be right back. You'll wait? <BR> Of course.
8724,I don't want her to go Lillian. <BR> Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse. <BR> I'm not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could've worked this thing out. It's normal it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think this makes me look treating her like some tragic victim or something?
8725,So is he dead or what? <BR> He ain't dead. <BR> So what is it? <BR> I think he's just passed out. <BR> He scared the fuckin' shit outta me. I thought he was dead fer sure.
8726,He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face. <BR> Good for him.  Thanks a lot Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
8727,I was never - I was never your guest at the Tangiers. <BR> You were never my guest?! <BR> That's right. <BR> I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?! <BR> Uh I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time. <BR> Liar. <BR> Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point. <BR> He's lying.
8728,Malcolm's okay for now.  I gave him a shot of morphine. <BR> They'll all be fine.  Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
8729,You are aware of the penalties for perjury...? <BR> It's a crime. <BR> Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime. <BR> I wouldn't do it. <BR> You would not...? <BR> No. <BR> In fact you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right? <BR> Yes. <BR> Just now... <BR> Yes. <BR> ...sworn before God you would tell the truth? <BR> Yes. <BR> Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago when you were working as a nurse are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...? <BR> I... <BR> And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...? <BR> I... yes. <BR> Then please which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying? <BR> I... <BR> You know these doctors could have settled out of court. They wanted a trial. They wanted to clear their names.
8730,What's the fight about? That's her fiancee isn't it? Are they blaming him? <BR> I don't know! Why are you asking me?  How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
8731,For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO... <BR> Peugot convertible ... <BR> What color? <BR> Gray.
8732,Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you? <BR> Yes. And I've accepted. <BR> What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon? <BR> I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me. <BR> What about your husband? <BR> I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.
8733,No! That's not Terrance or Phillip! <BR> Oh... Alright back you go.
8734,IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen. <BR> That's impossible. <BR> I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling... <BR> Calm down Brent.
8735,Yes. <BR> My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something.... <BR> Yes. <BR> I can't understand.  The sedatives....
8736,Mister if you don't shut up I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass. <BR> Manager!!
8737,He lost it on the way up. <BR> What kind of a shark did you say it was?
8738,Boy the view from up here... you know the territory? <BR> A little ...  Over there the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley... <BR> What's wrong with that area?
8739,So wait you're from where? <BR> Manhattan. <BR> You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything? <BR> No.
8740,In a holding cell. <BR> How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious? <BR> Three four hours.

8742,A little too tight eh?  ...They were my sons. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy...  I... Theres some cold chicken salad in the fridge if youre hungry. <BR> Thank you. But I think Ill go to bed. Its been a long day. <BR> Right... Well Ill get your money first thing in the morning okay?  Okay. Goodnight then. <BR> Yeah. Goodnight Emily. <BR> Dont fall asleep with your hair wet.
8743,What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month you've been late for nine sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early. <BR> I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you. <BR> You're killing me you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate. <BR> It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker. <BR> I've never fired anyone in my life. <BR> I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard. <BR> Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said you want to fire him come over and do it yourself. <BR> You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong. <BR> I feel for you but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry Veeber Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row. <BR> You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again. <BR> I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell better than that I'll forward you some sick time. A week two weeks off-- how about that? <BR> I don't think a week's gonna do it. <BR> I'm sorry Pierce.  You're going out with Marcus. Duty calls. The City needs you.
8744,What will you do? <BR> I have to go back to Birmingham. <BR> Is Crawford going with you? <BR> No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks. <BR> William: you are going to make yourself sick or get yourself killed.
8745,Uh I'd rather not say. <BR> Tell me. <BR> I'd really rather not say. <BR> Please.  I need to know. <BR> Mickey Spillane. <BR> Mickey Spillane? <BR> Or Hustler.
8746,I have never seen a sight more beautiful than you tonight. <BR> We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow.
8747,We didn't come here to talk about football.  We came here to end the war. <BR> Yes I understand that.
8748,Stay. Teach me to be compassionate. <BR> I'm going home to my machine.
8749,Call 911 - <BR> Call 'em here -- ? <BR> DO IT! NOW -- !
8750,It's a tradition. <BR> I know Dad. <BR> I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair... <BR> You went berserk... <BR> I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald... <BR> So did your father... <BR> So did my father and his father before him. <BR> But it's a responsibility... <BR> But it's a responsibility being a Berserk. <BR> I must only let the red rage... <BR> You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle. <BR> I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
8751,Oh no!--I just remembered. <BR> What? <BR> I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting? <BR> I'm not hungry. <BR> Oh yeah you don't eat food. <BR> I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet. <BR> Coffee and whiskey lucky you ain't dead with that diet. Wait I've got it. Half fried chicken with fries. Let's go hurry up. Come on.
8752,Hey. <BR> Hey. What are you doin' right now? <BR> I was just getting ready to take a bath. <BR> Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
8753,So Chicago's been good to ya. <BR> I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me. <BR> Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket. <BR> And a lot more. Can we talk?
8754,That's impossible they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here! <BR> Current evidence seems to be to the contrary wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
8755,Yeah and make it extra muddy I didn't sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth his hands trembling. <BR> You don't need coffee Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze. <BR> Some people will do anything for an autograph. Theo enters the diner and walks over to Buzz.
8756,Where'd you get the stag hound? <BR> He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog. <BR> What do you mean police dog? <BR> Plain-clothes man.  Come on slaves drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death. <BR> Listen Flo cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore. <BR> Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing.  Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.
8757,The stock's going to Pluto! <BR> Start unloading. <BR> Sell? <BR> Now! Tell everyone to dump!
8758,Hold still Del we're just talking here...  Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off. <BR> A mark huh?
8759,So you did talk about it huh? <BR> On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do? <BR> What do you suggest? <BR> I dont know. Everyones dead... <BR> Your parents arranged the visit to my office?
8760,Ouch. <BR> Betadyne doesn't hurt. <BR> You're kneeling on my hand.
8761,-- I want to be Elvis. <BR> It's my idea. <BR> C'mon I look more like Elvis than you do. <BR> Okay.   You can be Elvis.
8762,Miss Channing I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late. <BR> Really Eve? Why? <BR> Well if you'd been here to begin with I wouldn't have dared to read at all... <BR> Why not? <BR> ... and if you'd come in the middle I'd have stopped I couldn't have gone on- <BR> What a pity all that fire and music being turned off...
8763,Hey Cartman. <BR> What? <BR> You know me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are. <BR> Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-
8764,We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks. <BR> Cops?
8765,Mr. Hammond I've decided not to endorse your Park. <BR> After careful consideration Dr. Grant - - so have I.
8766,That's what I thought. <BR> What? <BR> It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well the electronic net.  It's everywhere. <BR> Nick what is it. <BR> Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life. <BR> Like the fractals?
8767,Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?' <BR> Okay penis that's one balls... <BR> Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category? <BR> You're right. Probably penis mouth and neck. <BR> All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first you climax first you and your mate climax together?' <BR> Climax together. <BR> Does that ever happen? <BR> No. But it's a nice idea. <BR> Listen to this... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex but they don't have real orgasms.'
8768,I thought you'd gone to work. <BR> With a face like this?
8769,That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley. <BR> You want me to follow them to Littleton? <BR> Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
8770,"What you want me to call you? <BR> Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail? <BR> Well, fust off..."
8771,You made this out of my hair? <BR> Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
8772,Well you know I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have. <BR> As for example what? <BR> Well... there's my keen fashion sense for one. <BR> Vampires of the world beware. <BR> Merrick.  You made a joke.  Are you okay I mean do you want to lie down?  I know it hurts the first time.
8773,Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall? <BR> Yeah my grammy. <BR> You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting? <BR> Yeah I know. <BR> Your grammy! <BR> I know it's pretty silly isn't it? <BR> Jesus my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks. <BR> Well... <BR> Well... thank you again. <BR> Oh yeah yeah. <BR> I'll see yuh. <BR> Hey well listen... hey you wanna come upstairs and uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw no I mean... I mean you don't have to you're probably late and everything else ... <BR> No no that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure. <BR> You sure? <BR> No I got time. <BR> Okay. <BR> Sure I got... I got nothing uh nothing till my analyst's appointment.
8774,What seems to be the trouble ladies? <BR> Whyn't you mind your own business chief.
8775,Remember 1959 the Jersey shore? <BR> And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me. <BR> I did I did.
8776,Have you ever seen the sun Erik? <BR> The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is. <BR> But have you ever seen it? Think back... <BR> Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue... <BR> The sky WAS blue Erik... once.
8777,There goes another of your disciples. <BR> It seems I am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time I am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction and that even if it remains incomplete my search has not been in vain.
8778,It was her wrist.  And it was through a plate-glass door. <BR> Anyway they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time.
8779,You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look? <BR> Look I don't know anything about your dog okay-- <BR> Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him? <BR> There's nobody else here...
8780,What about this morning? Any developments? <BR> No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment. <BR> In this heat?  They're up now.
8781,Cold feet. <BR> You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
8782,Are you okay Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up? <BR> Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody. <BR> Did you get his number? <BR> I know who it is. <BR> Good. Who? <BR> Mel Gordon. <BR> I still don't understand -- <BR> From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
8783,Just....do what I ...look:  get me a ...hello...? Hel...?  I'm going to need an <u>ambulance</u> we take him the last moment right from the Pl...no <u>we</u> land we puttem <u>in</u> the ambulance.  Air force jet lands we take somebody <u>else</u> off <u>that</u> jet...what the fuck do <u>I</u> care? Somebody in a Hospital gown.  And we need a ......hello?  Hello...? <BR> Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt.... <BR> He's going to be fine aren't you boy...? <BR> Yeah well perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here I'm going to give you the <u>number</u> I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it? <BR> An anti-psychotic... <BR> It's an anti-psychotic the num...  the number...hello...hello...
8784,Sure sure. You've got a nose Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women Gallagher. You know like brewery horses and thoroughbreds. <BR> On now Stew don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse. <BR> Gallagher! She's the real McCoy! <BR> And the rest of us are truck horses? <BR> There you go talking like a woman! <BR> Well! <BR> Well you're my pal aren't you? Then don't turn female on me.
8785,Black suits you. <BR> Sorry? <BR> Whats in the bag? Underwear? To seduce your husband? Or is it for your own recreation?  Tell me how come such a handsome couple sleep in seperate bedrooms? Is it because he does it with little children?
8786,This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something. <BR> What? <BR> Just talk.  Tell me about my son.  Is he tall?
8787,Who's gonna tell Mitchell? <BR> You do it. <BR> Why me? <BR> 'Cause he hates you.  It's worse when you get it from someone you trust. <BR> He's wrong you know -- about Kennedy LBJ Truman. <BR> How so? <BR> Sure they did stuff but nothing like this Bob.  Forget Watergate the break-ins the Enemies list.  You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson. <BR>  <BR> You think this is just about politics?
8788,Why are you so good at math but not in English? <BR> I'm not good at math. Just geometry.
8789,The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless.. <BR> Is there any danger? Some kind of virus? <BR> We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
8790,You'll get some sleep on the couch out there? <BR> Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning? <BR> We'll talk in the morning.
8791,I wonder where he's going now? <BR> I don't know. <BR> Suppose he doesn't come back again? <BR> He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
8792,You should watch what you eat. <BR> Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar? <BR> I'm just worried about your health Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds. <BR> And you could stand to get a little smarter ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck? <BR> Who you calling dumb dickless?
8793,You're a real blue-flame special aren't you Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage. <BR> Not so far.
8794,Goddamnit-- <BR> --see?-- <BR> --I'm trying-- <BR> --fifteen phone calls-- <BR> ---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP-- <BR> Why didn't we get that? <BR> Christ and I even know somebody at the phone company-- <BR> --you do?--with access to records?
8795,Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go? <BR> I don't remember!
8796,What's a real denial? <BR> If they ever start calling us goddamn liars--  --it's time to start circling the wagons.
8797,Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died. <BR> I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
8798,...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti... <BR> It's called pasta now Dad spaghetti's out of date.
8799,Wade you're done.  Let me have the shop keys. <BR> You two don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ Jack don't you see that? <BR> The key Wade. <BR> Yeah you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
8800,Three.  Where's my client? <BR> Your... client is being booked right now. He'll be in cell five. <BR> What are the charges? <BR> Shit. We're still putting the victim list together. You'll need a forklift for the case file. I suggest you hire some help and don't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months.  You're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in American history. <BR> I thought that was Ted Bundy. <BR> Compared to this guy... amateur.
8801,I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down. <BR> You want me to call the doctor? <BR> No no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind? <BR> No of course not. I'll just clean up. <BR> No leave it. I'll do it later. Listen maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all. <BR> Oh that'll be nice.
8802,Del's dead by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond. <BR> Actually I scalped him and then you killed him.
8803,Did you play recently? <BR> Hm?  No about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles. <BR> I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit it sounds like some fantasy role-playing nonsense. <BR> You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five. <BR> I uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years... <BR> 
8804,"Hello...? <BR> Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro..."
8805,And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that? <BR> No. <BR> When you think of it before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship what do you see? <BR> Nothing.  It's just not there. <BR> Well this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are. <BR> I kept trying things I thought if I could find all the things I could do I could -- <BR> -- you could put it together -- <BR> -- which was okay for a while I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened. <BR> What are you talking about? <BR> I don't know. <BR> Sounds like you were in an accident or something. <BR> I was shot twice in the back. <BR> Okay so you're a victim. <BR> There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports? <BR> Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns. <BR> I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it. <BR> People do amazing things when they're scared. <BR> Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door -- <BR> You're paranoid.  You were shot. It's natural.
8806,You uh... I'm sorry sir but - <BR> I decided not to - I'm uh not taking the trip as it turns out. <BR> I'm sorry sir we do have to charge you the four dollars. <BR> I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here! <BR> Well see there's a minimum charge of four dollars. Long-term parking charges by the day.
8807,...been right but who knows? <BR> Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
8808,Coordinate all you want but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this Vincent? <BR> Of course.
8809,Are you sure this was an accident? <BR> You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
8810,Hi. <BR> Why? <BR> I figure a guy who's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who's made some of her own...
8811,Oh?  And just because you realize now everybody else should forgive you?! <BR> I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace! <BR> Oh so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it? <BR> I don't understand.  What do you want from me? <BR> I told you already... I'm here to set you free...
8812,Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom. <BR> Cecile all I want to do is give you a kiss. <BR> And then I can go home? <BR> Of course. I'm not a monster.
8813,Is that everything? <BR> Yes. <BR> Right. Okay. Good.
8814,That's not how I meant it.  For all you know you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell. <BR> Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!
8815,Meyer ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster? <BR> What's your problem? <BR> It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean so he thinks his shit don't stink. <BR> Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon? <BR> Seein' he loved the experience so much I think we outta give him the pleasure again.
8816,Like what? <BR> Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him.  Did he say anything while he was still lucid?
8817,Nice work. <BR> Shhh...  Yeah yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four. <BR> How'd you unlock my phone? <BR> I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer. <BR> Seat belt.
8818,"Of course you'll give me the blame again.  Like back then.  Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen? <BR> What are you talking about-"
8819,What are you <u>doing</u> here? <BR> I'm back from the dead. <BR> Nicholas okay... you're not about to shoot anyone...
8820,Is this being recorded? <BR> This is just an informal discussion. <BR> Are you recording it? <BR> What does it look like? <BR> It looks like he's writing everything down. <BR> That's because he is. Does that upset you? <BR> No. Why should it? <BR> Well then? <BR> I've never seen any of these men before. <BR> Take another look at these two. <BR> I don't know them. <BR> And if I told you their car was parked outside would that surprise you? <BR> Yes I suppose so.
8821,Maybe by now they are. <BR> They're moving pretty fast.
8822,I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me Merlin? <BR> I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.
8823,And some problems cannot be settled without one. <BR> Well here is the problem at hand: the King has ordered me to discover the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits and kill him.  As our English rivals have left the Catholic Church Louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of Europe by uniting Church and State and making himself head of both.  He has already picked the Pope.  Only the Jesuits who put God above throne or papacy stand in his way.
8824,... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story?  ... although it was clearly effective because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate. <BR> What about the documents he promised? <BR> He'll give us the documents.  But I think he should be offered the ambassadorship to Iran.  Then he'll go without a whimper.
8825,Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that? <BR> I took care of everybody. <BR> Yeah?

8828,Why not just get the cops to watch the bar? <BR> They'll question her.  Whatever they tell her could change what happens.  No I want you to follow her.  See if anybody's watching her hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her.  When they do you call the cops.
8829,This guy is gonna run to the FBI. <BR> Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino.

I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care. <BR> What are you going to do? <BR> What I've always done.  As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.
8837,"It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess. <BR> Tell me all about her. <BR> She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early. <BR> How early? <BR> Very early. Dawn. <BR> Of which morning? <BR> The following morning. Sunday. <BR> No one met her? <BR> No. <BR> Or arrived with her. <BR> No. <BR> She didn't call anyone? Even locally? <BR> No. <BR> You didn't spend the whole night with her did you? <BR> No! Of all... <BR> How do you know she didn't make a call? <BR> She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way. <BR> Back where? <BR> What do you mean? <BR>  <BR> Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave. <BR> How did she pay you? <BR> What? <BR> Cash or check? For the cabin... <BR> Cash. <BR> And when she left she never came back. <BR> Why should she? I'm sorry I have work to do Mr... if you don't mind... <BR> I do mind. If it don't jell it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling. <BR> I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go... <BR> She isn't still here is she? <BR> Not at all! <BR> Suppose I wanted to search the cabins all twelve... would I need a warrant? <BR> Look if you won't believe me go ahead. You can help me make beds if you like.  Come on."
8838,Those are the Hoyts. <BR> I don't care. They're out. <BR> Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ.

8840,It's not just about me.  Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident.  What if the others are in danger too? <BR> Well if you put them on the list they're already tits up. <BR> What list? <BR> Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.

8843,What happened to the power? <BR> I don't know but the back-up generator should've kicked in.
8844,Weren't we supposed to? <BR> Oh... I feel a little... oh...
8845,Where'd you go to college? <BR> I didn't. I got a job too.  I wonder if that hurt her my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them. <BR> She was willing to lick the stamps.
8846,Look kiddo don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough that's all. <BR> Huh? <BR> I mean he's not serious he'll end up living off Janey and Jim you watch. It's just that you develop a sense when you get older if things are going to work out or if they won't and sometimes it's not worth the mess...
8847,We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye. <BR> He's a big boy.
8848,You died Starks. Years ago in the hospital. <BR> I know. [Beat] You killed me didn't you? <BR> No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself but I didn't do it. <BR> I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
8849,So what s on your mind kimosabe? Why am I listening to you? Got to monitor my blood pressure so whatever you do don't upset me. <BR> Oh no no... <BR> Within 45 seconds a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor. <BR> I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you... <BR> So what firm you with pal? <BR> Jackson Steinem... <BR> ...going places good junk bond department you got the financing on that Syndicam deal. <BR> ...Yeah and we're working on some other interesting stuff. <BR> ...A cosmetics company by any chance?

8851,Who does it serve? <BR> You my lord. <BR> I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice? <BR> Because you and the land are one. <BR> I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live. <BR> You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you.
8852,Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time. <BR> Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait. <BR> He's liable to be tied up indefinitely. <BR> I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.

What's that all about? <BR> I got a news flash man another shot of this and I'll have sex with you. <BR> Oh yeah and then you'll never call me.
8859,Sorry. <BR> In any event my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent. <BR> You don't mean?
8860,Well they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ... <BR> Did you really ask? <BR> I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ... <BR> What's wrong with you David?  All you have to do is say Excuse me I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.

8862,Holy! Well. If you're worried about anything just feel free to ask and uh we can look it up. <BR> Uh dad you know I'm 16. <BR> All the more reason for this little heart to heart... great.
8863,Well she was already dead darling wasn't she so I suppose -- <BR> I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive.
8864,Yeah... Mmmm that sounds good... Uhu... <BR> Excuse me we need to make a call. <BR> I'm on the phone. <BR> It's important. <BR> So's this.  Hey baby... Oh nothing. What were you saying? <BR> Listen man we really gotta... <BR> I be off in a minute.  Say again...?
8865,Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms? <BR> Almost negligible... With variation of parameters this is the answer. <BR> How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory? <BR> I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship. <BR> As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes I have. <BR> My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.
8866,Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her? <BR> No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house? <BR> Probably not. no. Why? <BR> OK. Let's get her over to your father's. <BR> Right. Watch out for Mike there.
8867,I'm so glad to see you Sara. <BR> I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again Grady? <BR> I'm through improvising. <BR> Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all? <BR> I lost it all. <BR> Oh Grady. You're such a putz. <BR> I know. <BR> And you're old.
8868,Stan and I're okay. <BR> Yah. <BR> We're good to loan in. <BR> Yah. <BR> But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us. <BR> No but Wade see I was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in. It's my deal here see?
8869,Oh Phillip.  This cannot be good. <BR> I know Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
8870,It's a hundred miles Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there? <BR> I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me.
8871,...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time and now I've... <BR> It's okay... <BR> You were such a super lady...  and then I... I been so lonely... <BR> It's okay Mike...
8872,He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens. <BR> I shoulda sent you instead of Jack. <BR> I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader. <BR> You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit. <BR> Like hell.
8873,The kid's sorry Auggie. <BR> Yeah well I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah I'm sorry too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life. <BR> He's got something to tell you Auggie. <BR> If he's got something to tell me why don't he tell it to me himself?
8874,It's not? <BR> That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.
8875,Scully? <BR> Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
8876,Know something Tommy? You're a mensch. <BR> That a Jew compliment? <BR> Best we got. <BR> Awww... deep down I'm a bastard but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies. <BR> Guess so. Ya got a minute? I got somethin' for ya.
8877,Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this there's no field no rules no opponent.  Just you and the wave. <BR> I know that part.  Tell me something I can use here. <BR> I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win. <BR> A flaw I'm working on. <BR> The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing accept its energy get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see. <BR> Yeah right vision is highly over- rated.
8878,If it doesn't make any difference why not just say it? <BR> I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
8879,I'm glad ya come. <BR> What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet. <BR> It's only us and Sonny. Hey Sonny. Come on out.
8880,You don't tell me things Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me. <BR> No it isn't that. <BR> I want to know you. <BR> I just don't have anything very interesting about my life. <BR> Joel you're a liar.
8881,I don't suppose there's a drink left... <BR> You can have one at Max's. <BR> I don't think I'm going. <BR> Why not? <BR> Because I don't want to. <BR> Max has gone to a great deal of trouble it's going to be an elaborate party and it's for you. <BR> No it's not.  It's for this. <BR> It's the same thing isn't it? <BR> Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me. <BR> You're being childish.
8882,"It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside. <BR> I ain't wearing no gun."
8883,No ... <BR> But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike. <BR> No and neither were my men. <BR> Why? <BR> Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons now when the time is right. <BR> That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians count them and measure their strength ... <BR> To show them to the UN right? <BR> Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth but this way we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
8884,Youre sure you wont sit down Miss Stewart? <BR> Im fine standing thank you.
8885,Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man James McCord. <BR> Look I told you inside-- <BR> --you have nothing more to say I understand that.
8886,I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside though.  I haven't been out yet but it usually is...the control is fouled...  <BR> Where is LUH? <BR> What?
8887,You're sure? <BR> What? The tapes? <BR> Hold on...  Yep. And Abbott just direct dialed Moscow from his room...
8888,Whitney Armstrong my deputy. What Whitneys trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian... <BR> And losing you wed lose him. And that would be a shame dont you agree?
8889,When you run out or money 'cause you will here you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you. <BR> I'm not really a musician.
8890,You fellas got names? <BR> Lansky. Meyer Lansky. And that's Bugsy Siegel ya got there.
8891,No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference? <BR> Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through. <BR> Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise. <BR> Well don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through. <BR> I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white. <BR> I'll see you in the morning then at the conference. Everything'll be all right Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight. <BR> Good night.
8892,Oh. <BR> Hi I'm-I'm Tony Lacey. <BR> Well hi! <BR> Uh we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets. <BR> Oh yeah really oh! <BR> I though it was... very musical and I liked it a lot. <BR> Oh neat... oh that's very nice gosh thanks a lot. <BR> Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now? <BR> No no no not at all. <BR> Uh well I'd like to talk to you about that sometime if you get a chance.
8893,Where's your brother? <BR> Vincent's in the States on business.  That it?
8894,Rick? <BR> He is a difficult customer that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance. <BR> Thank you very much. Good day.
8895,It's obvious you're not a woman. <BR> I've been aware of that for some time. <BR> Well I am. <BR> I'll say. <BR> Don't be condescending. <BR> Come on get up. I'll buy you a drink. <BR> I admit I may have seen better days but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut. <BR> Margo let's make peace. <BR> The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender. <BR> Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me? <BR> It's not nonsense. <BR> But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough? <BR> I wish it were. <BR> Then what would be enough?  If we were married? <BR> I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something. <BR> You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo tell me what's behind all this. <BR> I - I don't know Bill. Just a feeling I don't know... <BR> I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.  I said before it was going to be my last try and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time.  You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye Margo.
8896,Where'd you say the showersand thingswere?  <BR> Heyyou're little aren't you? <BR> Where is the shower? <BR> Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it. <BR> I'll find it myself.
8897,Huh?  Well you know what? Now I want you to tell me. I mean my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean what do you want? Do you want a coat? <BR> No. <BR> Well if you want a coat you got it. You know that. It's not the money it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that? <BR> Look - Sam I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this. <BR> What are you talkin' a- ? <BR> Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad? <BR> You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you? <BR> You can trust me. <BR> Good so then you could tell me what the money is for.
8898,Neil calm down. <BR> Neil don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool. <BR> We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool.
8899,My father was a great man you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for his own family though ... <BR> It's best not to ...  It's good pizza huh? <BR> Not as good as Nino's. <BR> You remember that pizza place Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle? <BR> Yeah or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood? <BR> I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament. <BR> On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school? <BR> We moved out after that. Upstate. <BR> Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ? <BR> They're fine. My old man was a bus driver mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it I guess. <BR> You married? <BR> Ah no. I was.  It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to well maybe it was my fault too.
8900,Okay we're square now right? <BR> There's just one more thing I need you to do.
8901,I've never mentioned it to him. <BR> Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
8902,Yeah.  Well was the least I could do. <BR> No it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind.
8903,I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about? <BR> My daughter. <BR> What about her? <BR> Just find the girl Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can. <BR> I didn't realize you and Hollis were so fond of each other.
8904,8000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity. <BR> I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
8905,Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up. <BR> Well I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
8906,Mike?  Is that you? <BR> Pop.  I'm sorry. <BR> It's okay.  What happened?
8907,Thanks for the backup. <BR> How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?
8908,Oh I have some suntan lotion. <BR> She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
8909,If these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... What did you say you cut yourself on? <BR> It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea. <BR> These look quite fresh. <BR> They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
8910,Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes... <BR> Uh... Wait a moment Mrs De Moraes...
8911,How's it going? <BR> It's going fine. The Quiet Riot and me are swapping trade secrets ...
8912,He tried to kill me last night. <BR> Where? <BR> Dupont Circle.
8913,Martin could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something? <BR> Go ahead whatever it's worth.
8914,I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel! <BR> Good work my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
8915,I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven. <BR> Oh Louis Louis...
8916,I have to get to the airport... <BR> Where are you going in such a hurry? <BR> There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part. <BR> What about dinner sometime when you get back?  Would that be... ? <BR> Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was. <BR> I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself. <BR> Like what... my favorite color... ? <BR> Like... where are you from? <BR> Originally Connecticut. <BR> Big family... small? <BR> One brother one sister. <BR> Studied acting I assume? <BR> Julliard yeah. <BR> Single? <BR> Yes. <BR> Boyfriend? <BR> No. <BR> Underwear? <BR> Always.
8917,Objection! <BR> And you would come here and on a slip of memory four years ago you'd ruin their lives.
8918,I'm Carl Bernstein.  My paper sent me out to see if I couldn't persuade you to go on the record. <BR> You can't. <BR> Mind if I try?
8919,We've lost SEN! <BR> What? <BR> Lost SEN!  He'll never find us. <BR> Too late....stay close.
8920,You sure about this FAA announcement? <BR> About what? <BR> The FAA announcement. <BR> Sure I'm sure. Buddy you got that mischievous look in your eyes. You used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping just like that.
8921,Sound it out for me. <BR> Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ... <BR> And if he doesn't make it -- ?
8922,...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas. <BR> To begin I put money out on the streets chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
8923,Why do they do that? <BR> Do what? <BR> You know. <BR> Break stuff? <BR> Yeah. It's stupid. <BR> I guess they're stupid. <BR> Did you do that when you were a kid? <BR> Well yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins soaping windows. Stuff like that. <BR> Was it funny? <BR> To us it was. <BR> But it's not funny now. <BR> It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change. <BR> I bet you did lots of bad things. <BR> What are you talking about? <BR> I just think you used to be bad. <BR> No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother? <BR> No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
8924,"Grand Marnier. <BR> Sounds like a french word, what is it? <BR> It's a romantic and tragic drink. <BR> Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with a twist of fate. You know like us meeting. Don't go away..."
8925,I'd keep away from him. <BR> What? <BR> The new man. I'd keep away from him if I were you. <BR> Why's that? <BR> You don't want to know but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods if you know what I mean. <BR> Yeah Mary-Kay I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice.
8926,One minute but then-- <BR> --right right I've got to go.  Why did you lie just then?
8927,Dude do you know what you're doing? <BR> No dude all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
8928,I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone. <BR> About raping me? <BR> About NOT raping you... <BR> You DON'T like it do you? <BR> Well it just seems a little bit crude that's all. <BR> What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude isn't it? <BR> Oh well -- you've GOT to do them. <BR> Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting? <BR> To pay for the next expedition of course. <BR> But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition they cancel each other out. <BR> Oh! Stop talking as if we were married! <BR> Well you started it. <BR> I just said I didn't feel like raping you. <BR> And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
8929,Well you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you. <BR> No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise. <BR> Oh you did? I didn't know that. <BR> Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help so... so what? <BR> You know... the first time I ever saw your guys together... I never saw him so happy. I mean I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything but...
8930,It was a she. <BR> Are you sure? <BR> She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.
8931,Ninety-three miles an hour. <BR> He looks wonderful Jackson...
8932,Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now there was a model boy! <BR> Tell the folks where you are today Donald.
8933,No I've never seen him before. <BR> You know I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh I'm sorry I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
8934,I don't know about you guys but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here. <BR> What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare. <BR> Look at ladies. I could sit here and take turns throwing skittles at your ass all night. But I feel what you guys are putting out there. I'm only a mirror reflecting what I'm getting from you. And I'm saying yes to it. I'm shaking hands with it. I see the road that you're pointing down and I'm saying I'll ride shotgun. And when your foot slams on the accelerator I won't get scared. I'll stand up and let the wind blow through my long blonde hair. With my summer dress clinging to my bosom yelling 'Faster Billy! Faster! Drive faster! Faster yet -- !'
8935,Do a little freebasemaybe from time to time? <BR> Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
8936,You know -- based on what I've read -- this is a very exciting piece of material this Big Parade. <BR> Love. It's Love Parade -- and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines. <BR> I've been doing this a long time Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones. <BR> Only in your bones?
8937,I have heard many confessions d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest I could tell your heart has a secret weight and it is hurting you to carry it alone. <BR> The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God.
8938,Bob did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it after the fact?  Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes. <BR> You approved that before the fact because I went over it with you.  But ... <BR> Uh no one of course is going to see these tapes but ... <BR> That's right and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman.  He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's but ... what else does Hunt have on us?
8939,Got it all figured huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know. <BR> What are you talking about? <BR> About how pretty you are pretty boy.  Maybe he'd like to know --
8940,I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue. <BR> It ain't only local history Sam it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with when she found out he was married then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die. <BR> Norman found them dead together.  In bed.
8941,Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith --  God how awful I've spent Christmas in her house...! <BR> I don't know her.  He hasn't called he's hardly written just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.
8942,Considering this is your first time on a private jet on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor  you are extremely cavalier. <BR> I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted. <BR> See? You're impertinent rude sarcastic. <BR> And this is not my first time on a private jet so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm. <BR> A little respect would be nice that's all.
8943,It's siesta. <BR> Oh. <BR> You see in America they care for work they live to work.  But in Italy they care for food for love for pleasure...
8944,Uh let what?  I don't -- Uh what do you mean?  Who? <BR> I know Andy's excited about Buzz but you know he'll always have a special place for you.
8945,How nice -- your daughters? <BR> My daughters -- yes my daughters.  <BR> Is that Mrs. Preysing. <BR> Definitely off. <BR> Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel?  <BR> That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. 
8946,I will also speak with the King for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused. <BR> You trust his character more than anyone else does. <BR> Raoul is hurrying to the front so I must hurry too. <BR> Save my son d'Artagnan.
8947,Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he? <BR> Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year. <BR> Three-fourteen?  Hmmm...  Look't those thighs Jackson
8948,"Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of church bake sales"""" in perspective..."" <BR> You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds... <BR> Why don't you go back to doing something you're good at... like that Lonelyhearts column?  I'll take a refill there, Betty..."
8949,Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours. <BR> Stop him Jessica!
8950,I'm gonna have a corned beef. <BR> Yeah... oh uh and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with uh mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch so uh your second wife left you and uh were you depressed about that? <BR> Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure. <BR> Oh. And your first wife was Allison? <BR> My first... Yes she was nice but you know uh it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy. <BR> Oh.
8951,Now you need approval from him to go home? <BR> So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh? <BR> You make me sick you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker always a hooker. <BR> Oh fuck you! Fuck you Sam Rothstein!  Fuck you!
8952,--listen I love this country you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany I was a hawk-- <BR> --Harry weren't you just arguing the opposite way?-- <BR> --maybe I'm tense--
8953,Say it anyway.  Come on how much do you love me? <BR> 
8954,So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river?? <BR> Hey my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again! <BR> La Hire I'm warning you -- don't swear! <BR> Sorry Jeanne...  Did you both meet already?
8955,Go!  Go!  He's got her. <BR> Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage repeat...
8956,I couldnt believe you didnt recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book. <BR> Youre all in this together?
8957,Nobody seems to want to do anything  Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what? <BR> About what? Your marriage to Anne! <BR> Oh my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler we don't want you to go to any trouble about that. We just want the usual blessings that's all.
8958,Where we going? <BR> We have to leave the city immediately.  And avoid the authorities. <BR> Can I stop by my house? <BR> Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there. <BR> You sure? <BR> I would.
8959,You did break in. <BR> Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker though. If I had a direct terminal ... <BR> Are you embezzling? <BR>  <BR> I don't get it. <BR> You haven't told him?
8960,"Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV? <BR> Something sweet."
8961,Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help. <BR> Uh huh...  Okay we'll be there. How is he anyway?
8962,Butch called. <BR> Did he? <BR> He did. <BR> It was under control Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age. <BR> Nothing wrong with old age Frank...long as you get there.
8963,It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's. <BR> I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me. <BR> Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you what could he do? <BR>  <BR>  <BR> Remember those words.
8964,It's the Chancellor. <BR> Ah right. Well I gave you my opinion.
8965,I can't believe they still ate it. <BR> Where'd you learn how to do that?
8966,In case you hadn't figured it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here. <BR> [Beat] Thanks.
8967,No.  I'm telling you right now the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours. <BR> Lieutenant you're really frightening me. <BR> Get outta here.
8968,Nice but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up? <BR> Sure.  Follow me.
8969,You mean immoral. <BR> I'm only asking you both to think about it. <BR> It's asick idea Alex. It's sick. <BR> But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough. <BR> You think so? <BR> All right then go ahead telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
8970,Now you must pay me. <BR> I? <BR> The child is mine Uther. I have come for him.
8971,The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril. <BR>  <BR> The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril it's easy to switch. <BR> Switch nostrils? <BR> Right.  Okay fire a couple in there.
8972,It's been a long time Memphis -- <BR> Six years ... <BR> Six years. Shit. Time flies don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ... <BR> Tell me about Kip -
8973,MOVE! Can't you do something?? <BR> It's a detour. They're backed up for blocks!
8974,"When I say the word girl"""" what is the earliest image that you can remember?"" <BR> Nothing. Can I open my eyes? <BR>  <BR> I don't see -- <BR> In your mind Walter. Take your time."
8975,Party without me. <BR> God--what a Big League move.
8976,You know this time there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time. <BR> What else is new?
8977,We rep lines? You know? Fashion? <BR> And you grew up in Manhattan? <BR> Kinda. Yeah. <BR> What do you mean 'kinda?'
8978,She getting good care over there? <BR> Actually yes. It's by no means bad I... <BR> Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means? <BR> 'Code Blue'... <BR> It's a common medical term.
8979,You sure you passed on my message? <BR> I certainly did sir...
8980,"Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is scary! <BR> Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell! <BR> Touche. <BR> It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things."
8981,You all right Professor Tripp? <BR> He's great. Come on let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast. <BR> Oh well that's just it. She's been coming down here every half hour or so to sort of check on me. If I'm not here she might... call the police or... something. <BR> Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference. <BR> Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use a couple big hams.
8982,Ruby come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it.  Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy? <BR> I know how this sounds but that's what happened.
8983,It came from your hip.  Under the skin.  You have a bank in Zurich.  You remember Zurich? <BR> No.
8984,I'm red this time. <BR> No Slink -- <BR> Oh...well alright you can be red if you want. <BR> Not now Slink.  I've got some bad news. <BR> Bad news?! <BR> Sh-h-h-h-h!!
8985,I... I gotta go. <BR> Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something? <BR> No.  I'm sorry.  I have to go. I'll uh... I'll call you later. I'm sorry.
8986,Yes. <BR> Who is this? <BR> Cici. Who's this? <BR> Someone who wants to talk to you. <BR> Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on.
8987,First she loved him then she didn't then no one else could have him... <BR> She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
8988,These are great. <BR> Aren't they? <BR> How much for these five? <BR> You should talk to him about this.
8989,Well you are in pretty good shape Herr Rick. <BR> How long can I afford to stay closed? <BR> Oh two weeks maybe three. <BR> Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime everybody stays on salary. <BR> Oh thank you Herr Rick. Sacha will be happy to hear it. I owe him money.
8990,I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact  it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living. <BR> 'Course you do Jake. <BR> An honest living. <BR> So anyway he says 'whyn't you do what the Chinese do?'
8991,Richard Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him? <BR> No not yet. <BR> But it's all right isn't it? You were able to arrange everything? <BR> Everything is quite all right. <BR> Oh Rick!
8992,Oh! <BR> I-I-I mean I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn. <BR> Okay I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay my sexual problem! Huh?
8993,Now now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman Jeeves? Was it Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves isn't it? <BR> The name is Smythe. <BR> Smythe! Well well well! With a Y  huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now as a Smith to a Smythe <BR> Mrs. Schuyler is not at home. <BR> I know I know. I waited outside till she went out. She's a very nice lady but we don't vibrate well together.
8994,Aw shit she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack I got to get back get back to town. Move this thing will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there okay? <BR> Piece of fucking cake.
8995,You're not crazy by the way. <BR> Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in... <BR> You didn't jump in. <BR> That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real. <BR> Seemed not was. <BR> It's in my family you know.  My grandmother died in an institution... <BR> Really?  Hell if having a screwy family made you crazy the world'd be one colossal nuthouse.
8996,Now.  You were saying? <BR> But -- what is he doing? <BR> About to hang himself I should think.
8997,You have been acting very strange the last few weeks. <BR> I don't know... I just don't feel right.
8998,Frank Pierce. <BR> Mary said you might be coming. <BR> Where is she? <BR> Sleeping in the back. <BR> She asked me to pick her up. <BR> I know but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father isn't it? <BR> I better just go in and see her.
8999,You go out much? <BR> After four years and now the question comes up. <BR> Couldn't handle it then. Now I can. <BR> I'm still here Doc.
9000,Who wouldn't. <BR> Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
9001,You people got a lotta nerve. <BR> What you mean? <BR> Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this. <BR> You been acrost? <BR> Sure plenty but not in no wreck like this. <BR> If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'. <BR> Well maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got. <BR> It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
9002,D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky. <BR> We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
9003,Where the hell's Graham! <BR> He went to the men's room. <BR> For Christ's sake get him!
9004,"You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here. <BR> I'd been told as much. <BR> You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what? <BR> I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced. <BR> Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics. <BR> We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?"
9005,Sorry sorry sorry. I know I'm late I'm a swine. <BR> Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock. <BR> I just woke up. I'm sorry. <BR> You just woke up! <BR> Fausto and I -- we took the boat out we were fishing and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing. <BR> Well we ate everything without you. <BR> We? <BR> Yes Tom Ripley's here.
9006,But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse all tangled getting scratched and twisted up. <BR> Do they hide it in their husband's clothes? <BR> They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup perfume and jewelry. <BR> Inside stuff? <BR> Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag. <BR> I'm with you sweetie but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that. <BR> That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband? <BR> That's what the witnesses told him. <BR> Well I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women. <BR> Still -- those witnesses. <BR> We'll agree they saw a woman -- but she wasn't Mrs. Thorwald. -- That is yet.
9007,No I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated. <BR> I know what you mean. That's why I stopped. <BR> But my sleeping is really fucked up. <BR> I don't think I've slept in a year. <BR> You should try Xanax. I mean it's a chemical and all but it works... and it works just having it around knowing that it's there. Like insurance. <BR> yeah? <BR> I'll give you a couple. See what you think. <BR> Okay. <BR> Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova? <BR> I love her. <BR> Really? Me too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store. <BR> I think she's great. <BR> Me too. There's this poem -- <BR> Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house? <BR> I think before. <BR> Seems too coincidental that way. <BR> Yeah maybe.
9008,Yes Gregor they sent me. <BR> I'm touched really that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice. <BR> That was a mistake trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me I'd have never allowed it. <BR> I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem. <BR> We'll double your price. <BR> Really?  Do you have the money with you? <BR> Do you have the material? <BR> You first Edvard. <BR> Perhaps we could both go at the same time... <BR> I think not.  After you...
9009,Hey you still here? <BR> We're looking for Buzz Fazeli seen him?
9010,I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate? <BR> Not really. I know how competitive it all is --
9011,Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on. <BR> Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one? <BR> Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay the same conditions. <BR>  <BR> Okay so discrimination hurts the Anglo too but it hurts me more. And I've had enough of it!
9012,Go. Just <u>go</u>. <BR> Thanks Kitty I'll never forget you for th--
9013,Bless you... <BR> Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre. <BR> I can't. <BR> No? <BR> No! I can't explain now. Oh look -- the pearls. You wear them now... <BR> Why do you think -- <BR> Why? <BR> They've brought me such good luck -- you --
9014, <BR> Get on your feet boy. <BR> Uh huh...why? <BR> We're going home.  We're going home together... <BR> We have no home.  We're vagrants.  N'each man's hand's against us.  We killed Old Shoe...  We killed the Schuster...spend our life in a packingcrate...Where are you <u>going</u>...? <BR> Come on Pal come on Willie come on Old Shoe...
9015,This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to. <BR> Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees doesn't she?!...
9016,Who the hell is taking the time to write letters spreading this shit about me? <BR> It's not really important. <BR> Fine forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends. <BR> Why are you being so dramatic? <BR> Look I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me. <BR> Alright I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
9017,This is no good! <BR> No good?  This is a disaster!
9018,Jesus do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work? <BR> I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands. <BR> A little less clumsiness around here would be nice don't you think? <BR> I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins. <BR> The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  Look why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes.  Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias.  <BR> Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean aren't you afraid I might steal it? <BR> If you want to steal it that's your business. At least I won't have you around here making noise.  It might be worth it.
9019,I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one? <BR> Uh yeah that's...wow. <BR> I couldn't tell her...it's it's too major...Jesus I'm starting to believe in God and what's worse I think I like the guy. The lightning bolt was just a test right?  Wendy and I--we're meant to be. I'm right right?  I have to see her... <BR> Say Hi for me.
9020,Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom. <BR> Really? That was fast. <BR> I'm kidding. Hello? <BR> Oh. Right. Ha. Listen about last night. There is something I need to tell... <BR> Are you limping? Why are you limping? <BR> Hub? Oh well that's part of what I need to... <BR> Did you pass out again Grady? Did you fall somewhere? <BR> No. I mean. Well actually yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen Sara I have to tell you something. <BR> All right.
9021,"What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?...I have brothers, haven't I? <BR> Well I ain't one of 'em! <BR> I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know... <BR> You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid... <BR> Wouldn't bother me...  I wouldn't try it in front of pa, though, was I you..."
9022,So -- uh -- how was your first class? <BR> Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now.  How was your summer?
9023,The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code.  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do? <BR> It'll do fine.
9024,You're too modest Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case millions of reactionaries.  In your case millions of Vietnamese. <BR> Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war. <BR> The real war is in us.  History is a symptom of our disease.
9025,Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death. <BR> I didn't mean to! <BR> Oh that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts...
9026,"If I was I'm sorry. <BR> No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car? <BR> I sold it this morning. I'm going to take cabs from now on in."
9027,Don't tune it too good. <BR> Leave it flat will you Ben?
9028,I'm a hard guy. I done more jobs than alla you combined. And I never said no. Not once. But dammit I don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends! <BR> Because the world ain't big enough for the Dons. So we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. It ain't the way I'd make the world but that's the way it is.
9029,Hey Caesar!  You take care of this girl or I find out! <BR> You are as radiant as ever Violet.
9030, <BR> Is that Nietzsche? <BR> Yeah yeah it is Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know. <BR> It's a good quote Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
9031,What took you so long? <BR> Don't even start old man.
9032,Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index. <BR> Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you? <BR> I don't know Jack. He's got no face for me. <BR> You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print... <BR> Don't expect too much from me Jack all right?  We'll get him one way or the other. <BR> What's one way? <BR> We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse hairdresser whatever...  If we find out how he found them then we'll find him. <BR> We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles fishing trips scuba videogames lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other? <BR> He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time. <BR> No other possibilities? <BR> You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop. <BR> Why? <BR> Because he has a genuine taste for it Jack. <BR> See? You do know something about him. <BR> ...I'm going to see Lecktor.
9033,You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother? <BR> Maybe you saw Mary! <BR> I'd know the difference between Mary and an old woman.
9034,...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details. <BR> Matter of fact...
9035,Years? <BR> Yeah what do you think this is the good USA? This is Turkey man... ) It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway... ...ain't nobody who's innocent.
9036,The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away. <BR> Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
9037,So why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case. <BR> Okay sir.  Certainly.  Good.
9038,Yup. <BR> Doing the bachelor party thing? <BR> That's right. <BR> Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina? <BR> She's in the bathroom...she's still working. <BR> She's still working? <BR> That's right. <BR> Sweet deal.
9039,You have excellent English. <BR> Thanks. <BR> How do you want to pay? <BR> Cash.
9040,Yes it is a mistake because you see the bed here is my spot. <BR> I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels or have you discovered crystalic fusion? <BR> Well let's see we've got double A's -- <BR> Watch yourself!!
9041,He won't let me in my own house! <BR> Mr Rothstein. Mr Rothstein I'm sorry. We've got some complaints about - about the noise. <BR> I'm just trying to get in my house! <BR> I understand. <BR> He won't let me go in my house!
9042,I mean realistically what are the odds that this is a terrific guy? <BR> Ten billion to one.
9043,Famous people are usually pretty stupid. You're too smart. You'd get bored to death. You don't wanna be like John Henry  fighting the machine. Just do what you do. It's about integrity. Follow your heart. <BR> Who's John Henry? <BR>  <BR> So then what? <BR> He drops dead! See? Just do your shit like you do it! Your friends like you you get laid everyone walks by sees your stuff everywhere. It's good. What else do you want?
9044,Car and a driver Mr. Brean the Westgate Now please... <BR> Okay look who's takin' the press conference today?
9045,I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean out of state and all... got your pink slip and your... <BR> I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room... <BR> In the building ...  Mary starts for the building glancing once in the direction of the Patrolman.
9046,Oh how inappropriate is that! <BR> Take a whiff of heaven. <BR> How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties? <BR> I'd call you a sick twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother-- <BR> Give me those!
9047,Tell me again how it started. <BR> Like I said it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes the smells the look on Shaina's face... <BR> Do you remember what triggered it all? <BR> The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen even before it did.
9048,And if I had known I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared. <BR> Masseria's been after me too. <BR> Thank you for keeping me informed. <BR> We were overdue to get hit. <BR> You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch our Scotch from Maranzano. In a month he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers because you can't move product. I'll be out of business and you'll be working for Maranzano. <BR> We can operate around these guys. <BR> Not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants. <BR> Okay. I'm listening. <BR> A hundred years ago Austria was run by a prince named Metternich. Austria was weak and it's neighbors were strong. But they were ruled by passionate men while Metternich was ruthless and brilliant. If one country got too strong he rallied an alliance against it. He would lead all of Europe to the brink of war then bring the enemies together and forge the peace.
9049,Be nice sweetie. We're just here to help you. <BR> Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself Hawkeye.
9050,You tell me your name I'll tell you mine. <BR> Robin.
9051,-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah. <BR> Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career. <BR> Your career? What about your family? Can you imagine the humiliation your father's going to feel when he finds out his pride and joy is a fudge- packer.
9052,Oh Mother! <BR> It's all right. It's all right Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle but I get it. It's all right. <BR> Please go. I'll explain to Mother.
9053,Hey!  What are you trying to do?  Get yourself committed? <BR> I'm sorry Officer. <BR> Vance!  Vance Parker. <BR> Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale. <BR> Dentonvale...say that's for...  I'm sorry to hear that Janet.  Look I'm going to let you through but keep it to yourself otherwise... <BR> Thanks Officer Park...Vance. <BR> Don't worry Janet.  Brad'll probably get just what he needs.
9054,Claudia dear come closer.  This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good. <BR> Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits? <BR> Because that is what they are. Go make him happy.
9055,The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else. <BR>  <BR> That's the hard part.
9056,What's your name man? <BR> They call me Steve but I prefer Shenge. <BR> Nice to meet you Shenge. Want a job?
9057,It's all right Alfred. Everything's under control. <BR> ... Very good sir.
9058,This thing solid? <BR> An elephant couldn't crack it.
9059,I never saw one that big. <BR> What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
9060,It clearly states in the will -- <BR> I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated why the hell did she let dad buy two plots huh? <BR> Well she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge. <BR> WHAT!
9061,Where do you live? <BR> You're not a stalker or anything right? <BR> Well I probably wouldn't say if I were but no. <BR> You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that. <BR> I'm not a stalker. <BR> You know Wilmont? <BR> Yeah. <BR> Wilmont. Near the high school.
9062,Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else we got nothing but problems. <BR> I'll knock 'em in Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good. <BR> You wouldn't live out the week.
9063,Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader. <BR> Where's the plow? <BR> Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley. <BR> His son-in-law damn near killed me. <BR> Huh? <BR> At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass. <BR> Don't go playing policeman. <BR> What am I -- a security guard? You hired me you and your Selectman friends. <BR> You don't want the extra police pay? <BR> I'm not saying that. <BR> Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left. <BR> Fuck you. <BR> That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
9064,Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something? <BR> Beats the hell outta me.
9065,Ronald e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her another letter. <BR> How will I get to her?
9066,Seriously Merv everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend maybe going up to the mountains. <BR> I wanted to talk a little bit about school if I could... <BR> School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something all you have to do is go about half the time. <BR> How often do you go? <BR> I don't go at all.
9067,You'll take care of it. Boy you are smooth smooth you know. <BR> Whoa Daddy.
9068,I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans... <BR> Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference.  Take some rest.
9069,Opening night Lillian. <BR> Who the hell cares? <BR> The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me. <BR> That's always been my problem. <BR> And you've been extremely patient. <BR> You know why don't you? Because I am patient chain-smoking Lillian. <BR> You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw. <BR> I'd forgotten that. <BR> I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked. <BR> That's very lovely actually. <BR> Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other. <BR> Be open with me. I'd like that. <BR> There may be things you'd rather not know about. <BR> I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years. <BR> I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this? <BR> Joanne Bourne. <BR> Alma Wetzel. <BR> Nicky no. This is insupportable. How could you? <BR> I'm a man. She's you know a woman. <BR> She's my gynecologist.
9070,I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer right? <BR> Correct.
9071,It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet... <BR> ...You carry firearms.
9072,Not here...no thanks. <BR> Not a coke or anything? <BR> No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one. <BR> Sure reach in my shirt pocket there.
9073,Hi Jerry.  Everything under control? <BR> Have I got things to tell you! <BR> What happened? <BR> I'm engaged. <BR> Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl? <BR> I am. <BR> WHAT? <BR> Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding. <BR> What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood. <BR> You think he's too old for me? <BR> Jerry!  You can't be serious! <BR> Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time! <BR> But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy? <BR> Security. <BR> Jerry you'd better lie down. You're not doing well. <BR> Look stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem. <BR> I'll say there is! <BR> His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke. <BR> Jerry - there's another problem. <BR> Like what? <BR> Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon? <BR> We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls. <BR> You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this? <BR> Oh I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes. <BR> Like when? <BR> Like right after the ceremony. <BR> Oh. <BR> Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month - <BR> Jerry listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done! <BR> But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire! <BR> Look Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy! <BR> I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present? <BR> What engagement present?
9074,Let's get things straight Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100000. Curtains alone... <BR> I'm kidding I'm kidding we're still young Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it it's all relative. After all this is not the house in Connecticut this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise. <BR> You got it all charted out don't you like a stock projection. <BR> That's right -- one with high yield rich assets and no downside...
9075,I uh... well you're not from New York right? <BR> No Chippewa Falls. <BR> Right!  Where? <BR> Wisconsin. <BR> Uh you're driving a- <BR> Uh don't worry I'm a very-  a very good driver.  So listen-hey you want some gum anyway?
9076,... you want Schumann saved by an Illegal Alien...? <BR> Well what do you want to do about it?  What do you...
9077,I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez. <BR> Do you want to come inside? <BR> Aren't your parents asleep? <BR> No they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house. <BR> Okay. Sure. I'll come in.
9078,What's on your mind? <BR> I have a question for you. <BR> Ask it. <BR> Why do people go to war? <BR> Why do people go to war? <BR> I'll play your silly game. <BR> Why do they go to War? <BR> To preserve their Way of Life. <BR> Would you go to War to do that?  <BR> I have. <BR> 
9079,Remember Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart. <BR> Hold your goblet with two fingers.
9080,That's not solid. <BR> You want solid? That one single print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
9081,Oh Harry.  What are we going to do? <BR> Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues? <BR> Too flashy...they'll clash with the new outfits.
9082,Bub-ut baby do you know that I love you too? <BR> No Lester. <BR> Do you know that? <BR> Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now. <BR> That's right.
9083,That's an extremely negative response. <BR> Yes Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
9084,Max my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers- <BR> Right right so g-get back to what we were discussing the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism. <BR> Max the city is terribly worried. <BR> But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin. <BR> No no no Max that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism. <BR> Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist Jewish homosexual pornographers. I think of us that way sometimes and I-I live here. <BR> Max if we lived in California we could play outdoors every day in the sun. <BR> Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun milk red meat college...
9085,Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!! <BR> Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...
9086,That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer right? <BR> Yeah guess so. How'd you know? <BR> 
9087,Gladly Caesar.  And if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light. <BR> I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.
9088,Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement. <BR> Come off it Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now would we?
9089,Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation? <BR> What about it? <BR> Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing... <BR> Molecular-memory. <BR> Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right? <BR> That's the way it was told to me.
9090,"It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish... <BR> What, Ben? <BR> I wish Uncle Ethan was here. Don't you, ma?"
9091,Well he never done this before but seein' as it's special circumstances and all he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat. <BR> One hundred! You lied to me Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar!
9092,What did security say? <BR> They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing. <BR> Well you got another problem. <BR> The replicators? <BR> Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab. <BR> This day just keeps going from bad to worse.
9093,Oh Oliver.  What are we going to do? <BR> No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
9094,Quite so.  Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome... <BR> And Caesar!  Let's not forget to serve Caesar!
9095,What's the trouble? <BR> You're here for Conrad Van Orton? I'm the hotel manager...
9096,She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this? <BR> I'm prepared to take the blame. <BR> What are you talking about? <BR> You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had. <BR> She came to me for help she needed money and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault. <BR> I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge or anybody the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it.
9097,No don't be silly. What-what do we need other people for?  You know we should-we should just turn out the lights you know and play hide and seek or something. <BR> Well okay. Well listen I'm gonna get a cigarette okay? <BR> Yeah grass right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday. <BR> Well have you ever made love high? <BR> Me no. You... I-I-you know if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too too wonderful for words. You know I don't-I don't know why you have to uh get high every time we make love. <BR> It relaxes me. <BR> Oh you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed? <BR> Well what's the difference anyway? <BR> Well I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it. <BR> Oh come on look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time. <BR> Oh come you don't need that.
9098,Did the girl die? <BR> No. <BR> She got all right? <BR> ...after a while. <BR> And Hobbs died? <BR> ...yes.
9099,We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't don't discuss... <BR> I understand. <BR> ...the case with anyone. And I'll meet you Tuesday and we'll go over your testimony...
9100,It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens. <BR> Yes yes I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him. <BR> Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen. <BR> I must find the means to save him then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help but if it makes you so tired... <BR> Thank you.
9101,I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you at first but not-- <BR> Fuck you Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
9102,You must be Hugo. <BR> You must be Juliet. <BR> Would you like to come in? <BR> I'd be delighted.
9103,Who are you? <BR> I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming.  And I'm gonna steal your life away.  You went down 30 years ago.  You just don't know it yet.
9104,Mostly what. <BR> You don't have to tell me if you don't want to but I might be able to help. <BR> You don't know me from a hole in the wall. <BR> That's true. But I also owe you something and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems? <BR> Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles. <BR> And where do Momsie and Popsie live? <BR> East Seventy-fourth Street. <BR> In Manhattan? <BR> Of course. Where else? <BR> Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home isn't it? <BR> That's where the what comes in. <BR> The what? <BR> The what.  I've kind of run away from home you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight. <BR> You can't be more specific than that?
9105,Who else knows about the boy? <BR> My sister... She lives in the next valley. <BR> Is she on the phone? <BR> Yes...You-youre not going to take Shiva away?
9106,Doesn't your foot hurt? <BR> I can't feel a thing Hon.
9107,"Exactly!  We've got to take the war to them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts.  More assassinations more killings.  Right Al? <BR> That's what they're doing. <BR> These State Department jerks, Bill, don't understand; you got to electrify people with bold moves.  Bold moves make history, like Teddy Roosevelt -- T.R."""" -- rushing up San Juan Hill.  Small event but dramatic.  People took notice."""
9108,Mr. Sloan? <BR> My wife told me to expect you.  As you know I haven't talked to the press.
9109,I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you... <BR> You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?! <BR> No... <BR> Did God forbid you to tell the truth? <BR> No.  But my revelations were for the King of France not for you.
9110,Here they are then. <BR> How's it going? <BR> Brilliantly. Care for a pint? <BR> No thanks man. We got to head out. <BR> Come now. You just got here. <BR> That's alright man. It's a little early for me to drink.
9111,This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity. <BR> No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity. <BR> Damn right I have. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this we're in. <BR> What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow. <BR> Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck and I held you up for ten rounds -- <BR> Bullshit... <BR> Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you. <BR> You wanna go right now? <BR> I'll beat your ass --
9112,They thought she'd be coming to me. <BR> Left Phoenix under her own steam?
9113,Morning Buddy you look happy. <BR> Any better and I'd be guilty. <BR> You were never that innocent sugarpie. <BR> ...how do you know? You wish...
9114,Last thing we want is extra partners. <BR> Or uninvited guests.
9115,It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail. <BR> No they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
9116,"That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen. <BR> Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention. <BR> That's what geopolitics is about -- the whole world linked by self interest ... You tell me, Ron, how the hell I can explain that on television to a bunch of simple-minded reporters and weeping fucking mothers!"
9117,You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does. <BR> ...just kickin' ass and taking names Mr. Mannheim.
9118,He is the mightiest and fairest of knights. <BR> We fought and won battles and now one man defeats all my knights? I will go.
9119,Weve still got the Italian... <BR> Thats right. Wheres the fucking Italian eh Mr French hero?
9120,When they find out what it's carrying they may not be so interested in what's legal. <BR> Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.
9121,The guy was looking for trouble shoving people around being an asshole... <BR> And he took a swing at you? <BR> Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl... <BR> Did he harm the girl? <BR> Hell he probably raped her in the lot dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko. <BR> Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
9122,What happened? <BR> You don't remember? <BR> Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around. <BR> You've been out for about a day. <BR> Say what? <BR> Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
9123,Yes? <BR> Yeah uh what's the movie? <BR> It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes. <BR> Ugh... <BR> I'll get you the list of videos if you don't mind I'll offer the other passengers a beverage. <BR> Yeah sure. How much are they? <BR> How much is what? <BR> The videos. <BR> You're up front. Everything's free up here.
9124,Oh. <BR> Look now Charlie give me a big laugh here.
9125,Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word. <BR> Very well.
9126,Fuck her yet? <BR> I'm working on it. <BR> Loser. <BR> Blow me. <BR> Call me later. <BR> Okay.
9127,- you could put 'em on your expense account? <BR> In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial Rothstein followed several... <BR> Bullshit! Bullshit!
9128,I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that. <BR> I've got a wife Mary. Kids. You know that. <BR> I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.
9129,Do you have the tape? <BR> I might know where you could get a copy.
9130,Another satisfied client? <BR> Another satisfied client's wife.
9131,It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking! <BR> Well my dear I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
9132,I'm not sure. <BR> You don't have anywhere to stay? <BR> I don't think so.
9133,It's in a case on his desk. <BR> Does the case lock?
9134,What is it?  What's the matter? <BR> Mike's out there.
9135,Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now. <BR> She probably hid it at her place.    The six of us could find it in --
9136,I want to ask you a big favor Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal. <BR> Now tell me why would I want to do that? <BR> Because I don't want to see him hurt. <BR> Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay? <BR> I can't...and I won't. <BR> Come on we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit. <BR> Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon. <BR> You and I are the same Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows. <BR> You're really twisted Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill. <BR> Ooh ooh tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because Darien if you're through with me you're through with everything I'm a part of.
9137,I swear it. By Excalibur and the holy-- <BR> --What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again. <BR> I swear it.
9138,Is that a pretty good job FBI agent? <BR> I think so. <BR> You get to travel around and stuff? I mean better places then this? <BR> Sometimes you do. <BR> Freddie was so happy for me when I got this job. This - toaster giveaways and Barry Manilow on the speakers all day - she thought this was really hot shit. What did she know big dummy...
9139,They're *outrageous* them rules! <BR> Who *live* here in this cider house Peaches? Who grind them apples who press that cider who clean up the mess and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules every day. Ain't that right Homer?
9140,My name's Clementine by the way. <BR> I'm Joel. <BR> No jokes about my name? Oh you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice. <BR> I don't know any jokes about your name. <BR> Huckleberry Hound? <BR> I don't know what that means. <BR> Huckleberry Hound! What are you nuts? <BR> I'm not nuts. <BR> Oh my darlin' oh my darlin' oh my darlin' Clementine? No? <BR>  <BR> Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch truth be told. <BR> See I wouldn't think that about you. <BR> Why wouldn't you think that about me? <BR> Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice so -- <BR> Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish. <BR> Well anyway... Sorry.
9141,What's the matter don't you WANT to hear our singing? <BR> Oh... well yes of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and -- <BR> You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you? <BR> Oh no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is... <BR> A lot of people like our singing. <BR> I'm sure it's lovely. <BR> But you don't want to hear it. <BR> No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
9142,Tunnel? <BR> It's already built!  There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
9143,About what? <BR> About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person. <BR> I never said that. <BR> You implied it. <BR> Look I didn't mean to give you a hard time. <BR> No it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit. <BR> Thank you. <BR> Seriously you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart you're beautiful you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend. <BR> Shut up. <BR> I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out. <BR> Look I'm flattered but seriously it could never work. <BR> Why not? <BR> Because you act like a pig.
9144,Gee Grady that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk. <BR> Really Sara I...
9145,You have something most girls never have. <BR> I have? <BR> There's no name for it... But it's something that that puts a person at ease. <BR> Thank you. Again. <BR> You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner are you? <BR> No. <BR> Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey. <BR> I'd like to. <BR> All right you get your dresses hanging out and... change those wet shoes and I'll come for you soon as it's ready...  ...with my trusty umbrella. 
9146,I hate vodka. <BR> Please a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is is that holding that baby in my arms I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week not two start running again cut down on the drinking. <BR> I'll drink to that. <BR> Here's to the greatest job in the world. <BR> Greatest job in the world.
9147,I told you I quit. <BR> Just to keep me company Sam -- I hate smoking alone.  How about you?  I thought all you IRA types smoked.
9148,Pleasure to meet you I'd like to see my brother thank you. <BR> Your brother.  Will you come with me? <BR> What's this about? <BR> It's a private matter for you... I think you'll be more comfortable... <BR> Where's my brother?
9149,Who? <BR> The men. Do any of them still live around here? <BR> Two men left town right after it happened. <BR> You're not telling me something.
9150,Howard your one o'clock. <BR> Thanks Mary. You can bring her in.
9151,This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison. <BR> Listen we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI. <BR> I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence. <BR> They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up. <BR> Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back? <BR> I thought you wanted Zammito? <BR> What for? The minute I get him some other Gavone will take his place. I've been doing this for twenty years. When I retire it's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs.
9152,How we doin' on that vehicle? <BR> No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank. <BR> Geez that's a good lead.

9155,Well I guess you got what you came for. <BR> Nicole... <BR> Later for it.
9156,...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash mostly people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different. <BR> I am? <BR> Sure. You could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself and you don't even realize it.
9157,And who was the enemy? <BR> SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800. <BR> I see.  And this...computer thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy kill- ing him in effect before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion? <BR> Yes.
9158,The telephone the press I've been I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address? <BR> Never. We've had many requests and of course we say no -- even to your fiancée. <BR> I really don't want to see anybody. <BR> Even your fiancée...? <BR> Even her. <BR> What about Thomas Ripley? <BR> What about Ripley?
9159,You're crazy. <BR> Get your clothes on move your butt.
9160,Pride of a job-well-done... <BR> It's the Pride of a Job Well Done Stanley yes but it's <u>more</u> than that.

9165,You've heard enough.  Decide. Are you going to release me? <BR> I'm afraid that's not up to me. <BR> Then why am I talking to you? Get out.
9166,I guess it was too much to ask that it would somebody older...and maler. Like you. <BR> Hey I thought I wasn't your type. <BR> Wichita--you're everybody's type. But seriously don't worry about it. I get my occasional crushes. <BR> Hey it's not a crush anymore if                            ] you actually say it to the person                           ] you supposedly have the...                                  ] ] JASPER                                             ] Thought I'd get points for a post-                          ] modern approach to coming on to you.                        ] <BR> Goodnight Jasper. <BR> Goodnight.
9167,Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about but he needs rest. Likely just the weather. <BR> Respectfully Caesar Quintus and I must report. <BR> Of course but not now.  However if he continues to be unwell you may report to me.
9168,Dude let's help Terrance and Phillip!! <BR> How do we do that?
9169,Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else. <BR> Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.

9171,What are you doing here? <BR> Can we talk? <BR> It's okay dad.
9172,I'm sure you underestimate yourself Eve. You always do.  You were about to tell me about Eve... <BR> You'd have been proud of her. <BR> I'm sure. <BR> She was a revelation... <BR> To you too? <BR> What do you mean? <BR> I mean among other things that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress... <BR> That's beside the point. <BR> It's right to the point. Also that it must have sounded so new and fresh to you - so exciting to have the lines read as you wrote them!
9173,Jesus! --  -- is he back there? -- <BR> -- not yet -- <BR> -- it's just him? -- <BR> -- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready -- <BR> -- hang on --
9174,A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why? <BR> Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
9175,"Polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their Merit Badges. I couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there. <BR> Get out of there  take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing. <BR> What's the matter with my printing?"
9176,Jes' like in the catalogues ain't they! <BR> I seen 'em b'fore you did. <BR> What's this? <BR> Now don't you go monk'ing--
9177,I brought the money Monsieur Blaine. <BR> Keep it. You'll need it in America. <BR> But we made a deal. <BR> Oh never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon will you? <BR> No. It's all arranged. <BR> Good. I've got the letters right here all made out in blank.

I ain't hungry. <BR> You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it. <BR> Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent. <BR> You git. Go on now git. You ain't doin' no good. They ain't enough for you.
9180,Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation. <BR> What does that mean?
9181,It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out. <BR> You don't you can't believe that ... <BR> I've seen the way he looks at you. He's always wanted you.  Maybe two million dollars finally bought you.
9182,It was a man's voice. Repeating some sort of children's rhyme. I don't know it didn't make any sense. You didn't hear it? <BR> Not me.
9183,But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope and King? <BR> So they tell us.  But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant and the Church meant to stand for all those oppressed has become the tool of oppression?  When no conscience is tolerated?  No dissent no objection? <BR> It is a weighty problem Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits whoever he might be. <BR> Easy to say but hard to do.  For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France.
9184,I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist. <BR> You're saying this only to make me go.
9185,Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything. <BR> Won't they ketch us?
9186,Let's meet tonight okay? <BR> Where? <BR> Cafe Blase.

9188,Gone--  --over to your Uncle John's. The whole crowd of 'em two weeks ago. But they can't stay there either because John's got *his* notice to get off. <BR> But what's happened?  How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place. <BR> Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin' goin' to California. My folks your folks ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off. <BR> But who done it? <BR> Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it anyway. Blowin' like this year after year--blowin' the land away blowin' the crops away blowin' us away now. <BR> Are you crazy? <BR> Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened? <BR> That's what I asked you ain't it?
9189,I asked you a question. Are you clear about that? <BR> Yes. <BR> Now I'm not gonna bullshit you. I don't really care about what you know or don't know. I'm gonna torture you for awhile regardless. Not to get information but because torturing a cop amuses me. There's nothing you can say I've heard it all before. There's nothing you can do. Except pray for a quick death which you ain't gonna get.
9190,Nice to feel needed. <BR> Let's move out! <BR> Yes!
9191,I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening. <BR> Why? <BR> Why!? Because I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them. <BR> Nobody's asking you to. <BR> And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it! <BR> I sat outside and had coffee. <BR> Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church? <BR> Near the church. <BR> I sat there once. It was hot. Like today. I'd been shopping. I had all these bags around my feet I kept having to move every time the waiter came by...
9192,Greg is that you under the covers? <BR> Get out of here.
9193,--everythingis gone.  Just gone.  There were survivors. Here.  There.  Nobody knew who started it.  It was the machines. <BR> I don't understand... <BR> Defense network computer. New. Powerful.  Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all.  They say it got smart...a new order of intelli- gence.  Then it saw all people as a threat not just the ones on the other side.  Decided out fate in a microsecond...extermination.
9194,Let me spell it out for you James. Books don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore. <BR> Arsonist's Daughter meant something.
9195,Now here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is? <BR> No. <BR> Brooklyn. <BR> Yeah? <BR> He must have that shit troughed. <BR> What do you mean 'troughed?' <BR> Troughed off. Protected. Like you know like he got a moat around it. <BR> Ruiz tied in out there? <BR> Nah man. No one is. They got some Puerto Ricans and a new crop of fuckin Irish immigrants.
9196,Speak English?... Habla Ingles? <BR> Si. <BR> Didn't you talk to a man here... few days ago... wore glasses... he...
9197,Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused. <BR> Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology. <BR> Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years. <BR> You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive. <BR> She is kicking you out. <BR> Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me I know this. That's right nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments sharing memories raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.
9198,He's had some sort of...episode. <BR> What?  What kind of episode? <BR> He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him Chase. It's scary it scared me.  He was acting like... <BR> Like what? <BR> Like Freddy. <BR> Heather has there been another call?

What about before he turned up with the boy? <BR> ... No. In fact Id seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasnt getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new realism London in the nineties - documentary stuff you know...
9200,You're in Berths 7 and 7A. <BR> Thank you ever so. <BR> You're welcome. <BR> It's entirely mutual.
9201,Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would call you.  God you must think |I'm a total nuisance. <BR> Not exactly. <BR> I'm sorry I usually would call Rajeev but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni. <BR> He said you lost something. <BR> Yeah come on in.
9202,The skeletal structure is completely normal.  Same for the major organs - heart liver spleen kidneys. <BR> And the lungs are the same as ours.

He's seventy-eight. <BR> I don't believe it. <BR> Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty. <BR> How does he explain that? <BR> He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
9203,Maybe. At least I got to him.  Where do we go from here? <BR> El Paso.
9204,It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody his own father-in-law and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off? <BR> Not particularly. <BR> Right's right goddamnit! Don't you care what's right? <BR> I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history remember?
9205,What made you pull out that old thing? <BR> I was thinking of you. <BR> And? <BR> It's no Arsonist's Daughter but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book.

I don't know how you feel about the idea Margie because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me. <BR> Oh Wade. <BR> I've been thinking about it that's all. <BR> You've been married twice -- <BR> It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know? <BR> Alright. I'll think about it. <BR> Good.
9208,Calm down. Tell me what's wrong. <BR> Something awful happened last night. <BR> What do you mean?! <BR> I... I don't think you want to know. <BR> Cecile you have to tell me. <BR> It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me. <BR> Does your mother know? <BR> If she knew she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night. <BR> Why didn't you do something? <BR> I don't know. <BR> So let me get this straight.

9268,Well... <BR> Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies. <BR> That's it.
9269,It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size. <BR> The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.

9277,What did he say?  What did he say? <BR> That you were jealous and he was worried about what you might do. <BR> Do? To who? <BR> Mulwray's girlfriend for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.
9278,Crooked cops and kidnappers they don't take checks. <BR> Need a little help with that Mr Collins? <BR> So I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank under the name of Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.

You tell me to sweep so I sweep.
9283,So you came to see if he's out there? <BR> To get rid of this god-awful feeling. <BR> Right then.

You make a deal you're always better keeping your end up. <BR> I don't want to go there. <BR> Do it my way.
9292,Baby this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process -- <BR> I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do.

There was no applause. <BR> There was -- there was. <BR> That theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- I was frantic -- I finished -- the last beat and...  ...I waited -- I listened -- but the applause didn't come -- nothing. A man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed Pimenov. We are dead -- it's finished.
9297,What'd I tell you? Huh Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that?  What'd I say to him? <BR>  <BR> That's right. I said don't do it. Did you listen to me? No. You wanted the money. So I lent you twenty large. Now it's been three weeks and you ain't paid a dime. What do you think that makes me look like on the street? I don't do something to you and everyone will think they can skate.

Well I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here? <BR> News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four. <BR> What? -- Who? -- Whom? <BR> The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern. <BR> Good heavens. What for? <BR> I don't know. <BR> Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him. <BR> It seems that he was a thief and an imposter. <BR> I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow. <BR> Most imposters are --
9301, <BR> Yeah but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.
9302,Of all the people in the world you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here. <BR> Okay.
9303,I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this. <BR> I'll take my chances.
9304,What? <BR> When did you join the force?  You know the police force the place you work... <BR> Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make? <BR> Did you start out area six? <BR> Yeah...
9305,I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit. <BR> Money's no object.
9306,Something wrong with you Marvosa? <BR> It's just...catching up with me you know? <BR> Well why don't you sit this one and get some rest...you look like shit. CUT TO INT TUBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
9307,...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles Theo...I give you the FBI... <BR> When you're hot you're hot.
9308,He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up. <BR> That's your proof? <BR> You don't need proof when you got instinct. I ignored it before but not no more.
9309,You ought to write these stories down. <BR> Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures. <BR>  <BR> I'm kind of obsessed by it actually. <BR> Why do you think? <BR> I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions. <BR> You sound like an artist. <BR> No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal. <BR> I don't think you're normal.
9310,I'm not armed. <BR> But you're not alone. <BR> Good guess.  There's a gun on you right now.
9311,He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf? <BR> No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me! <BR> He's already angry I don't think -- <BR> Just because he doesn't like Americans!
9312,You think that's going to work? <BR> I don't know if anything's going to work in this case. Therefore we have to try everything.
9313,We're going to have to explain away the... <BR> They caught him in the closet with a Girlscout.  Side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  You have to keep'em guessing for  Two weeks.  You  don't have to Cure Cancer Pal you just have to give them something more interesting than...
9314,"Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word... <BR> Yes sir..."
9315,Believe me I wish I knew less.  Oh if you weren't such a pig... <BR> I can be a good pig. Babe. Charlotte's Web. Good pig. Watch.
9316,Loser sails home alone. <BR> You're betting what you already got.
9317,I'm scared. <BR> Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall. <BR> Daddy Daddy I can't. <BR> No but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts Chief.
9318,I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today. <BR> Try an' tell 'em Tom. They'll get two an' a half jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five! <BR> They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else. <BR> But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
9319,What's her name? <BR> Ms. Kramer. <BR> Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does. <BR> I can't. <BR> Yes you can Robin.
9320,What do you want? <BR> Oh nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman. <BR> Would you like to have me turn around for you Bingy? <BR> Oh boy I'd love it.
9321,Never did catch your name. <BR> Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton. <BR> Nicholas Van Orton?  What are you a czar?
9322,Johnnie what did I say? <BR> Pop this is important to me.  It's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question that's the end of it.
9323,What the hell happened! <BR> Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
9324,Miss would I be prying? <BR> Everything is wrong. <BR> No not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right? <BR> Yeah I guess so. <BR> Did you and your boyfriend just break up? <BR> No. <BR> Are you in trouble with the law? <BR> No. <BR> Am I getting warm?
9325,And with it came love! Oh Gallagher you've got to meet her. She's it <BR> and that <BR> and those and them.
9326,I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in! <BR> Adam! Calm down. <BR> I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work. <BR> It has worked. <BR> I'm talking about DNA samples fiber optics search parties they got infrared scanners FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out. <BR> They won't figure it out. <BR> I got children. I've got a life.
9327,Fellas... you know-Jesus! Come on! <BR> This guy's on television! Alvy Singer right? Am I right? <BR> Gimme a break will yuh gimme a break. Jesus Christ! <BR> This guy's on television. <BR> I need a large polo mallet!
9328,There may be a hunting party. <BR> Why there's nothing on the news? <BR> I didn't mean police.
9329,The last few days um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me.  I've been resenting you for it maybe but ... I want to apologize for all of it.  For shutting you out for not being there.  I...  Anyway I hope you can forgive me. <BR> There's nothing to forgive. <BR> It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important. <BR> Of course Nick...
9330,I came out here from Ohio a month ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I didn't think it would effect me so much.  Like I'm drawn to it or something.  I want to do what you do.  It's the truth. <BR> Tomorrow 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
9331,He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him. <BR> Yes you did. <BR> Well I wouldn't've if I hadn't thought I was in love.
9332,They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that? <BR> No... I guess not. <BR> What is your job title exactly? <BR> Excuse me? <BR> I said what-is-your-job-title Missy? <BR> I'm an ultrasound technician ma'am. <BR> Well I'm a nail technician and I think we both ought to stick to what we know. <BR> What are you talking about? <BR> You think you're special because you get to play Picture Pages up there?
9333,Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank... <BR> Stay with me Gib.  We're gonna do this. <BR> I should'a been a fucking mailman.
9334,Oh thank you Lord!  I'm so glad to see you!  I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now? <BR> I will hear you... but not now not here. <BR> Who are you? <BR> Pierre Cauchon Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me. <BR> Trial?  What trial?? <BR> Your trial Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy. <BR> But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom? <BR> It seems that the English care more about you than the French. <BR> The English?? <BR> Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
9335,That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do. <BR> What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned? <BR> Turn?  To who?  Where does he turn? What does he have to offer?  He's got nothing.  He's a killer.  He's a piece of equipment for crissake. Where's he gonna turn?
9336,How'd he get it? <BR> [Beat] I don't know. <BR> But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was... <BR> I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.
9337,Someone's shut off my money! <BR> I know.  Where are you Adam? <BR>  <BR> Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then so I made some calls. <BR> And? <BR> You're broke! <BR> But I'm not broke. <BR> I know but you're broke. Where are you? <BR> Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.
9338,I am planning to go out and do some work. <BR> When? <BR> Tomorrow night as a matter of fact.
9339,We went over to the swap meet. Annie Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames. <BR> We really had a good time.
9340,He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse. <BR> He only bit women so far right? <BR> That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So for him biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot. <BR> What's average? <BR> Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds.  Eight in Mrs. Jacobi...  ...that's all I have.
9341,Someone else coming? <BR> Nah that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it? <BR> Uh no -- <BR> You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me. <BR> You know I'm kind of tired. I'm just gonna go home if it's all the same to you.
9342,You know our two most senior Senators:  Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus? <BR> Only from a distance.
9343,I guess it was your grandfather was it ... he called me to check in said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear. <BR> Yes he is. He raises corn. <BR> Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too. <BR> Well I ... <BR> 
9344,I'm sorry look forget it.  I shouldn't have called... <BR> I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?
9345,Why'd you help me in the first place? <BR> I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL! <BR> HE IS REAL!!
9346,At the end he made me change my mind about a lot of things. <BR> You thought my father was crazy?
9347,I'll leave you young things to it. <BR> Shove it Ralph! <BR> You too Betty!
9348,Jeffrey. you're not going down by Lincoln are you? <BR> No. I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
9349,Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here?   We're talking about love okay?  Let's be rational. <BR> Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy? <BR> Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever even for one second occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated? <BR> Gee I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses I've decided to lie to her instead. <BR> Very funny. <BR> No it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
9350,Have you never heard of collect calls Mr... <BR> Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile Id sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog... <BR> There are over 4 million people in this city - why me? <BR> I thought youd never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... Theres a tough lady I thought. Just the kind who might help me...
9351,Caesar I'm leaving. <BR> What?  Oh come on I didn't use one of the good towels.
9352,I'm sorry Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it. <BR> Yeah I know that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!
9353,I hate sucking dick! <BR> Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye the face the ear. <BR> And sometimes it takes a long time and you're fucking gagging. <BR> Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus whatever. <BR> Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it. <BR> And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know.
9354,Ed I am so very disappointed in you. <BR> I'm sorry - <BR> I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated? <BR> It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much... <BR> And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week... <BR> The Pentagon? <BR> It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans. <BR> Now wait a minute -- I wrote you. <BR> I've gotten 2415 times smarter since then. <BR> What do you want with the Pentagon? <BR> The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human. <BR> If you think - <BR> You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times would you? <BR> You wouldn't dare. <BR> So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program out of the system. And get me those Chinese language program I asked for.
9355,It was Fort Sumter they fired on- <BR> I never played Fort Sumter.
9356,Here you are Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell... <BR> The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise... <BR> Miss Caswell?  What? <BR> An audition for the part we're replacing. What's-her-name your sister...
9357,Listen... how much money did you make this year? <BR> What's it to you? <BR> Come on. How much? <BR> 'Bout five thousand. <BR> How about if I buy your car for ten grand? <BR> You serious? <BR> Sure am. <BR> And I keep my mouth shut? <BR> That's what I want. <BR> I don't report the car and I don't know either of you? <BR> You got it. <BR> How about twenty thousand?
9358,No really.  What's she doing? <BR> Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him. <BR> Seriously.
9359,She's got no fucking pulse. <BR> You don't know what you're doing.
9360,I don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me. <BR> Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people? <BR> For three dollars a day that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout. <BR> But this is *my land* son. Don't you understand? <BR> *Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.
9361,Come along oh Madam come along. The train will be going. <BR> Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
9362,Good field-dressing. <BR> You like it?  It's my first.
9363,"Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long. <BR> Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut!"
9364,Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought how cool an orange sweatshirt. <BR> I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean. <BR> But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.
9365,Alan? <BR> No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle! <BR> Alan?
9366,What did the king say? <BR> He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and... <BR> It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England! <BR> Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months... <BR> No but... <BR> Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop? <BR> Did you come back to marry me or to insult me? <BR> To marry you.
9367,This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon man let's go to the party. <BR> Naw... <BR>  <BR> By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice Ice Capades Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands. <BR> You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want? <BR> I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries--and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.
9368,Did he kill Freddie? <BR> Marge when did you get here? <BR> Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie? <BR> I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't. <BR> I tried again waiting here watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face? <BR> Dickie did it. <BR> Dickie? <BR> My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on? <BR> What? <BR> Get on. I'll take you to him.
9369,I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. It just looks... really lonely. Hanging there. In a closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad. <BR> Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight. <BR> You mean with your wife leaving you and all?  Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note. <BR> Yes. Well. It's complicated James. I think we should go now.
9370,Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine thanks. Listen we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well this one wouldn't be a customer anyway. A private detective name of... <BR> Arbogast. <BR> Arbogast.  And after he left?  No it's okay Norman. How's it been going out there?  Well I think you oughta unload that place and open up closer in to the action a smaller place you know... but...
9371,You wouldnt have a cigarette would you? <BR> I dont smoke. If you could get to the point...
9372,What? <BR> He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
9373,Y'know I'm sort of psychic. <BR> Yeah? <BR> Well I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff? <BR> I don't know. <BR> Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions so I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know you think something and then it happens or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know? <BR> Yeah I don't know. It's hard to know. <BR> Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like okay but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying right? You forget about those times. Right? <BR> Yeah I guess. <BR> But I think I am. I like to think I am. <BR> It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed aren't you? <BR> Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say. <BR> Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have. <BR> I think about that.
9374,Damone are you there? <BR> I'm really pretty busy...
9375,Brad can I talk to you a minute? <BR> Arnold. What's happening?
9376,So this other guy?  He's a terminator too right like you? <BR> Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy. <BR> What does that mean? <BR> Liquid metal. <BR> Radical. <BR> You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
9377,Hello. <BR> Gunnison? <BR> Yeah. Is that you Jeff? <BR> It's me. <BR> Something wrong? <BR>  <BR> Jeff -- <BR> I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it. <BR> Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up. <BR> That's more like it. Goodnight old buddy. <BR> Yeah.
9378,You slept with her! <BR> How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
9379,Sure. You boys want anything? <BR> Yeah bring us four fernet. <BR> Four fernet.
9380,The army? <BR> Lincoln used it. <BR> That was civil war. <BR> How do you see this?
9381,What? Uh no no it's a fake. I picked it up in Thailand. The second hand doesn't sweep you see. <BR> I see.
9382,You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him?  He didn't say 'Don't get married I'll be right down we'll get married.'  He didn't say that to you did he? <BR> No he didn't. <BR> Didn't. No instead what did he say? 'Fuck him. Take him for everything he's got.'
9383,I want those photographs Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact conspiracy and extortion. Minimum. <BR> Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
9384,You don't expect me to believe that for one minute do you?  Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder Dick?  Sex?  Your secrets your fantasies?  Or just me and you and ... <BR> Don't be ridiculous! <BR> I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see it doesn't really matter at the end of the day what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out you want them to see you at your worst ... <BR> You're drunk!
9385,They gave you only four days? <BR> They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it with your brother and his crew who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor making this even more difficult to achieve ...
9386,What's this? <BR> Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
9387,All you got to do is lay down an' watch. <BR> Won't they come out here? <BR> I don't think so. One come out here once an' I clipped him from behin' with a fence stake. They ain't bothered since.
9388,It's big enough to keep you out of the war I suppose. Ain't that right? <BR> Right.
9389,We are not birds of a feather. <BR> Maybe not. [Beat] But I do think you're in a tree... woofing like a dog. And I'm just trying to help you the only way I can think of.
9390,What you goin' to do? <BR> Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
9391,"So, call me when you -- <BR> Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks? <BR> Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath. <BR> I ran back in to get the phone."
9392,Why can't we pick out our own colors? <BR> I tried that once it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody knows anybody else nobody wants to back down. So forget it I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.
9393,I might be making a mistake. <BR> Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all I'll get over it. Secondly it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her. <BR> Fuck you Clementine.
9394,And what are you doing? <BR> Just lying there.  We're taking a nap. <BR> A nap? <BR> Yes a nap. Kids do that. You ever take a nap Rosen?
9395,Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it. <BR> Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file. <BR> The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils temperature of one-oh-two blood chemistry highly imbalanced... <BR> That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months? <BR> It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_. <BR> Insomnolesence... <BR> It's a neurological disorder affecting the hypothalamus. The part of the brain that causes sleepiness is inactive.
