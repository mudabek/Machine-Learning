My works in the following
- computer vision (classification, segmentation, detection, etc.)
- natural language processing (translation, language generation, etc.)
- reinforcement learning (Q-learning, DQN, PPO, DDPG, etc.)
- big data (hadoop, scala, spark)
- optimization (various algorithms)
- various machine learning algorithms (boosting, random forest, data engineering, etc.)
